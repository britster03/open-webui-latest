## src/lib/apis/auths/index.ts

This TypeScript code defines a collection of API service functions related to authentication and user management in a web application. These functions interact with a backend server, likely a FastAPI application we discussed earlier, performing operations like signing in, signing up, updating user profiles, and managing application configuration. Let's break down each function:

### `getSessionUser(token: string)`
Fetches the session user details using a provided JWT token. It makes a `GET` request to the `/auths/` endpoint with the Authorization header. If the request is successful, it returns the user data; otherwise, it logs the error and throws it.

### `userSignIn(email: string, password: string)`
Handles user sign-in by sending the user's email and password to the `/auths/signin` endpoint via a `POST` request. If the request fails, it captures the error, logs it, and then throws it.

### `userSignUp(name: string, email: string, password: string)`
Allows a new user to sign up with their name, email, and password by sending a `POST` request to the `/auths/signup` endpoint. Errors during the request are logged and thrown.

### `updateUserProfile(token: string, name: string, profileImageUrl: string)`
Updates the user's profile with a new name and profile image URL. It requires authentication, indicated by the Authorization header in the `POST` request to `/auths/update/profile`. Errors are handled similarly to other functions.

### `updateUserPassword(token: string, password: string, newPassword: string)`
Updates the user's password. This function sends the current and new passwords in a `POST` request to `/auths/update/password`, using the provided JWT token for authentication.

### `getSignUpEnabledStatus(token: string)`
Checks if the sign-up feature is enabled on the backend. It makes a `GET` request to `/auths/signup/enabled` with the JWT token. This could be used to conditionally show or hide the sign-up UI based on the server configuration.

### `getDefaultUserRole(token: string)`
Fetches the default user role from the backend by making a `GET` request to `/auths/signup/user/role`, useful for understanding the role new users will be assigned upon registration.

### `updateDefaultUserRole(token: string, role: string)`
Updates the default user role setting on the backend. It sends the new role in a `POST` request to `/auths/signup/user/role`, requiring an admin JWT token for authorization.

### `toggleSignUpEnabledStatus(token: string)`
Toggles the sign-up feature's enabled status on the backend, sending a `GET` request to `/auths/signup/enabled/toggle`. It's used to enable or disable new user registrations.

### `getJWTExpiresDuration(token: string)` and `updateJWTExpiresDuration(token: string, duration: string)`
These functions fetch and update the JWT expiration duration, respectively. They interact with endpoints `/auths/token/expires` and `/auths/token/expires/update`, allowing for dynamic control over token validity periods.

### Error Handling
Each function employs a pattern of making an asynchronous request using `fetch`, then processing the response. If the response indicates failure (`!res.ok`), the function attempts to parse and throw the error response. This approach ensures that calling code can catch and handle errors appropriately, such as displaying error messages to the user.

### Authorization Headers
For operations requiring authentication, these functions include an Authorization header constructed using a JWT token (`Bearer ${token}`). This token is likely obtained during sign-in and stored on the client side, perhaps in local storage or cookies.

### Summary
This collection of API service functions encapsulates the interaction between the frontend and the backend for authentication-related features. It demonstrates how to perform common tasks like user sign-in, sign-up, profile updates, and application configuration management in a modern web application.

## src/lib/apis/chats/index.ts

This TypeScript code defines a series of functions designed to interact with a FastAPI backend (as previously discussed) from a frontend application, likely built with a framework like Svelte, React, or Vue. Each function corresponds to a specific API endpoint for managing chat functionalities, including creating, listing, updating, and deleting chats and their associated tags. The functions utilize the `fetch` API for making HTTP requests to the backend.

### Constants
- `WEBUI_API_BASE_URL`: Imported from a constants file, this likely represents the base URL of the backend API.

### Functions Overview

#### createNewChat
- Creates a new chat by sending a `POST` request to `/chats/new`.
- Requires an authentication token and the chat details as arguments.
- Handles errors and returns the created chat data.

#### getChatList
- Retrieves a list of chats by sending a `GET` request to `/chats/`.
- Requires an optional authentication token.
- Handles errors and returns an array of chat objects.

#### getAllChats
- Fetches all chats regardless of the user by sending a `GET` request to `/chats/all`.
- Requires an authentication token.
- Handles errors and returns an array of all chat objects in the system.

#### getAllUserChats
- Gets all chats related to a specific user by sending a `GET` request to `/chats/all/db`.
- Requires an authentication token.
- Handles errors and returns an array of chat objects associated with the user.

#### getAllChatTags
- Retrieves all tags across chats by sending a `GET` request to `/chats/tags/all`.
- Requires an authentication token.
- Handles errors and returns an array of tag objects.

#### getChatListByTagName
- Fetches chats filtered by a specific tag name by sending a `GET` request to `/chats/tags/tag/{tagName}`.
- Requires an authentication token and the tag name.
- Handles errors and returns an array of chat objects tagged with the specified tag name.

#### getChatById
- Retrieves a specific chat by its ID by sending a `GET` request to `/chats/{id}`.
- Requires an authentication token and the chat ID.
- Handles errors and returns the chat object.

#### updateChatById
- Updates a specific chat by its ID by sending a `POST` request to `/chats/{id}`.
- Requires an authentication token, the chat ID, and the new chat details.
- Handles errors and returns the updated chat object.

#### deleteChatById
- Deletes a specific chat by its ID by sending a `DELETE` request to `/chats/{id}`.
- Requires an authentication token and the chat ID.
- Handles errors and returns the deletion result.

#### getTagsById
- Retrieves tags for a specific chat by its ID by sending a `GET` request to `/chats/{id}/tags`.
- Requires an authentication token and the chat ID.
- Handles errors and returns an array of tag objects associated with the chat.

#### addTagById
- Adds a tag to a specific chat by its ID by sending a `POST` request to `/chats/{id}/tags`.
- Requires an authentication token, chat ID, and the tag name to be added.
- Handles errors and returns the addition result.

#### deleteTagById
- Removes a specific tag from a chat by sending a `DELETE` request to `/chats/{id}/tags`.
- Requires an authentication token, chat ID, and the tag name to be removed.
- Handles errors and returns the deletion result.

#### deleteTagsById
- Deletes all tags from a specific chat by sending a `DELETE` request to `/chats/{id}/tags/all`.
- Requires an authentication token and the chat ID.
- Handles errors and returns the deletion result.

#### deleteAllChats
- Deletes all chats by sending a `DELETE` request to `/chats/`.
- Requires an authentication token.
- Handles errors and returns the deletion result.

### Error Handling
Each function utilizes a consistent error-handling pattern:
- Errors from the `fetch` API or the server are caught and logged.
- If an error occurs, it's thrown, allowing the calling code (in the frontend application) to handle it, perhaps by displaying an error message to the user.

### Summary
These functions form a comprehensive API client library for a chat feature within a larger application, abstracting the details of making HTTP requests and handling responses. This modular approach facilitates easier maintenance and development of the frontend application by providing a clear interface to the backend API.

## src/lib/apis/configs/index.ts

This TypeScript code snippet is part of a frontend application, likely built with a JavaScript framework like React, Vue, or Svelte (given the use of `$lib/constants`). It contains two asynchronous functions, `setDefaultModels` and `setDefaultPromptSuggestions`, which interact with a backend server's API to configure default models and default prompt suggestions, respectively. Let's break down each part of this code for a clearer understanding:

### Imports
- The snippet begins by importing `WEBUI_API_BASE_URL` from a constants module within the project. This variable is expected to hold the base URL of the backend API.

### setDefaultModels Function
- **Purpose**: To send a POST request to the backend API to set the default models configuration.
- **Parameters**:
  - `token`: A string representing an authorization token. This is likely a JWT or a similar token used to authenticate the request.
  - `models`: A string containing the models to be set as default. The exact structure of this string isn't specified but could be JSON or a comma-separated list of model identifiers, depending on the backend's expectations.
- **Process**:
  - The function sends a POST request to the endpoint `${WEBUI_API_BASE_URL}/configs/default/models` with `Content-Type` and `Authorization` headers. The body of the request includes the `models` parameter, serialized as JSON.
  - It uses the `fetch` API for making the HTTP request and handles the response asynchronously.
  - If the response is not OK (i.e., the HTTP status code is not in the 2xx range), it throws an error with the response body.
  - Any caught errors are logged to the console, and the error detail is saved to the `error` variable.
  - If there's an error, it is thrown, halting the execution of the function. If the request is successful, the response is returned.

### setDefaultPromptSuggestions Function
- **Purpose**: Similar to `setDefaultModels`, but for setting default prompt suggestions.
- **Parameters**:
  - `token`: Same as in `setDefaultModels`, used for request authorization.
  - `promptSuggestions`: A string containing the prompt suggestions to be set as default. This might be structured data serialized as a JSON string.
- **Process**:
  - Follows a similar process as `setDefaultModels`, but the POST request is made to the endpoint `${WEBUI_API_BASE_URL}/configs/default/suggestions`. The body includes the `promptSuggestions` parameter.
  - The handling of the response and errors follows the same pattern as `setDefaultModels`.

### Error Handling and Responses
- In both functions, errors from the API response are handled by throwing them after they're caught, allowing the caller of the function to handle them (e.g., by showing an error message to the user).
- Successful responses are returned to the caller, potentially including data from the API that confirms the changes were made.

### Summary
These utility functions abstract away the details of making specific API calls to configure the application's backend. By encapsulating these requests in dedicated functions and properly handling tokens and responses, the frontend code remains cleaner, and interactions with the backend are standardized. This approach also simplifies error handling and the propagation of any errors or data back to the UI for user feedback.

## src/lib/apis/documents/index.ts

This TypeScript file is part of a frontend application that interacts with a backend server via API endpoints, specifically focusing on document management functionalities. It defines several asynchronous functions to create, retrieve, update, tag, and delete documents. Each function communicates with the backend through the Fetch API, handling HTTP requests to specific endpoints and managing authentication tokens. Let's break down the purpose and workings of each function:

### `createNewDoc`
- **Purpose**: Creates a new document on the backend.
- **Parameters**: Accepts authentication token, collection name, filename, name, title, and an optional content object.
- **Process**: Sends a POST request to the `/documents/create` endpoint with the document details in the request body. If the request succeeds, it returns the response data; otherwise, it catches and throws any errors encountered.

### `getDocs`
- **Purpose**: Fetches a list of documents.
- **Parameters**: Accepts an optional authentication token.
- **Process**: Sends a GET request to the `/documents/` endpoint. It returns the list of documents if successful or catches and throws errors if not.

### `getDocByName`
- **Purpose**: Retrieves details of a specific document by its name.
- **Parameters**: Accepts authentication token and the document's name.
- **Process**: Sends a GET request to `/documents/name/${name}`. Returns the document's details on success or throws an error if failed.

### `updateDocByName`
- **Purpose**: Updates a document's name and title based on its current name.
- **Parameters**: Accepts authentication token, the current name of the document, and a form object containing the new name and title.
- **Process**: Sends a POST request to `/documents/name/${name}/update` with the new details. Returns updated document information on success or errors out if failed.

### `tagDocByName`
- **Purpose**: Tags a document with one or more tags.
- **Parameters**: Accepts authentication token, document's name, and a form object containing the document's name and a list of tags.
- **Process**: Sends a POST request to `/documents/name/${name}/tags` to update the document's tags. It handles success or failure as above.

### `deleteDocByName`
- **Purpose**: Deletes a specific document by its name.
- **Parameters**: Accepts authentication token and the document's name.
- **Process**: Sends a DELETE request to `/documents/name/${name}/delete`. It returns a confirmation of deletion on success or errors if the operation fails.

### Error Handling and Authentication
- Each function uses try-catch blocks or promise chains with `.catch()` to handle errors that may occur during the fetch operation. Errors are logged to the console and rethrown to be handled by the calling context.
- The authentication token is passed in the `Authorization` header of each request, following the Bearer token scheme. This is required for endpoints that need authentication.

### General Workflow
1. **Preparation**: Gather necessary data (e.g., document details, authentication token).
2. **Request**: Initiate an HTTP request to the backend API with the appropriate method (GET, POST, DELETE), headers (including authentication), and body (if needed).
3. **Response Handling**: Process the response from the backend, handling success and failure cases appropriately.
4. **Error Management**: Capture and manage any errors or exceptions that arise during the request or response processing.

This setup allows the frontend application to interact robustly with the backend's document management system, providing functionalities essential for creating, managing, and organizing documents within the application.

## src/lib/apis/litellm/index.ts

This TypeScript code provides a set of utility functions designed to interact with an API, presumably for managing machine learning models on a platform referenced as "LiteLLM." These functions facilitate the fetching of model information, adding new models, and deleting models through HTTP requests. Here's a breakdown of each function and its purpose:

### Constants
- `LITELLM_API_BASE_URL`: A constant imported from a configuration file that holds the base URL of the LiteLLM API.

### getLiteLLMModels Function
- **Purpose**: Fetches a list of models from the LiteLLM API.
- **Parameters**: Accepts an optional `token` parameter for authorization.
- **Process**:
  - Makes a GET request to the `/v1/models` endpoint.
  - Includes an `Authorization` header if a token is provided.
  - Parses the response, transforming it into a JSON object.
  - If the response is not OK, it throws an error with the message from the API or a default 'Network Problem' message.
  - Transforms the list of models into a specific format and sorts them by name.

### getLiteLLMModelInfo Function
- **Purpose**: Fetches detailed information about a specific model from the LiteLLM API.
- **Parameters**: Accepts an optional `token` parameter for authorization.
- **Process**:
  - Similar to `getLiteLLMModels`, but targets a different API endpoint (`/model/info`).
  - Processes the response in a similar manner but returns detailed info about models without additional transformation.

### addLiteLLMModel Function
- **Purpose**: Adds a new model to the LiteLLM platform.
- **Parameters**: Accepts a `token` for authorization and a `payload` object containing information about the new model.
- **Process**:
  - Sends a POST request to the `/model/new` endpoint with the model details in the request body.
  - The request body includes `model_name` and a `litellm_params` object that contains model parameters such as `model`, `api_base`, `api_key`, and `rpm` (requests per minute).
  - Processes and returns the response similarly to the fetch functions.

### deleteLiteLLMModel Function
- **Purpose**: Deletes a model from the LiteLLM platform.
- **Parameters**: Accepts a `token` for authorization and an `id` for the model to be deleted.
- **Process**:
  - Sends a POST request to the `/model/delete` endpoint, including the model `id` in the request body.
  - Processes the response similarly to the other functions, throwing an error if the operation fails.

### Error Handling
All functions use a similar pattern for error handling: they catch errors from the fetch request and throw a custom error message. If the request fails (e.g., due to network issues or an invalid response from the server), an error message is logged, and a custom error is thrown.

### Summary
This set of functions abstracts the complexity of HTTP requests to the LiteLLM API, providing a clean and reusable interface for interacting with the API within the frontend application. It encapsulates the authentication, error handling, and formatting of the API responses, making it easier for other parts of the application to manage machine learning models without directly dealing with the intricacies of API requests.


## src/lib/apis/modelfiles/index.ts

This TypeScript code defines a set of functions to interact with a backend FastAPI server for managing "modelfiles." These functions are part of a frontend application, possibly built with Svelte or another JavaScript framework, that communicates with the server via RESTful API endpoints. Each function is designed to perform a specific operation related to "modelfiles," including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting model files. Let's break down the purpose and functionality of each function:

### `createNewModelfile`
- **Purpose**: To create a new model file record on the server.
- **Parameters**: `token` (authentication token), `modelfile` (model file data to be saved).
- **Process**: Sends a `POST` request to the `/modelfiles/create` endpoint with the model file data. If the request is unsuccessful, it captures and throws the error detail.

### `getModelfiles`
- **Purpose**: To retrieve a list of model files from the server.
- **Parameters**: `token` (optional authentication token).
- **Process**: Sends a `GET` request to the `/modelfiles/` endpoint. It processes the response, returning a transformed list containing only the model file data from each record. If an error occurs, it is thrown.

### `getModelfileByTagName`
- **Purpose**: To fetch a specific model file by its tag name.
- **Parameters**: `token` (authentication token), `tagName` (the unique identifier of the model file).
- **Process**: Sends a `POST` request (note: this might ideally be a `GET` request if fetching data) to the `/modelfiles/` endpoint with the tag name specified. If the request is successful, it returns the model file data; otherwise, it throws an error.

### `updateModelfileByTagName`
- **Purpose**: To update an existing model file's data by its tag name.
- **Parameters**: `token` (authentication token), `tagName` (the model file's identifier), `modelfile` (the new data for the model file).
- **Process**: Sends a `POST` request to the `/modelfiles/update` endpoint with the tag name and new model file data. It updates the specified model file if the request succeeds; otherwise, it throws an error.

### `deleteModelfileByTagName`
- **Purpose**: To delete a model file by its tag name.
- **Parameters**: `token` (authentication token), `tagName` (the identifier of the model file to be deleted).
- **Process**: Sends a `DELETE` request to the `/modelfiles/delete` endpoint with the tag name. If the request is successful, it confirms the deletion; otherwise, it throws an error.

### General Workflow
All functions follow a similar error-handling pattern:
- They send an HTTP request to the specified endpoint.
- They await the response, checking if it's an error response (`!res.ok`), in which case they throw the error details.
- For successful requests, they parse the JSON response and return it.
- If an exception occurs during the request or response handling, it logs the error and potentially rethrows a more user-friendly or specific error based on the context.

### Security Note
Each function includes an `Authorization` header with a bearer token, indicating that these operations require authentication. The token is presumably obtained after a user logs in, ensuring that only authorized users can manage model files.

### Usage
These functions can be imported and used in various components of the frontend application, providing a seamless interface for interacting with the backend's "modelfiles" functionality.

## src/lib/apis/ollama/index.ts

This TypeScript code defines a set of functions to interact with a backend API, referred to as the "OLLAMA API," from a frontend application. These functions handle various tasks such as retrieving and updating API URLs, fetching version information, managing models, and generating content based on templates and prompts. Let's break down the functionality provided by each function:

### Base Structure
- **Imports**: The code begins by importing necessary constants and functions from other modules, notably `OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL` from a constants file, which likely contains the base URL of the backend API.
- **API Functions**: Each function is designed to perform an HTTP request to the OLLAMA API for different purposes, handling the response and any errors that may occur.

### Functions Overview

- **Parameters**: `token` for authorization, `speaker` specifies the voice model, `text` is the input text to synthesize.
- **Process**: Sends a `POST` request with the payload to synthesize speech. Similar error handling as in previous functions.

### Error Handling
- Most functions follow a similar error handling pattern: if the fetch request is not successful (non-OK response), the function parses and throws the detailed error message. If a network error occurs, a general server connection failure message is thrown.

### Usage
These functions encapsulate the logic for interacting with the OpenAI API, abstracting away the specifics of making HTTP requests and handling responses. This makes it easier to use OpenAI's capabilities within a frontend application by calling these functions wherever needed, passing in the necessary parameters (like authorization tokens and request data).

This approach promotes code reuse, consistency in error handling, and separation of concerns by keeping API interaction logic in a dedicated module.

## src/lib/api/prompts/index.ts 

This TypeScript code defines a set of functions designed to interact with a FastAPI backend from a frontend application, specifically handling operations related to "prompts." These prompts could represent text commands, templates, or any form of content that the backend manages. Each function makes HTTP requests to specific API endpoints to create, retrieve, update, or delete these prompts. Let's break down each function:

### Base URL
- `WEBUI_API_BASE_URL`: A constant imported from a configurations file, likely containing the root URL of the backend API.

### createNewPrompt
- **Purpose**: Sends a POST request to create a new prompt.
- **Parameters**: Accepts a `token` for authorization, and the `command`, `title`, and `content` of the prompt to be created.
- **Process**: Makes an asynchronous fetch request to the `/prompts/create` endpoint, including the `authorization` header with the provided token. The body of the request contains the prompt data in JSON format. If the request is successful, it returns the created prompt's data; otherwise, it throws an error with the details.

### getPrompts
- **Purpose**: Retrieves a list of prompts.
- **Parameters**: Accepts a `token` for authorization.
- **Process**: Sends a GET request to the `/prompts/` endpoint. It processes and returns the fetched list of prompts if the request is successful. In case of an error, it throws with details.

- **Purpose**: Updates an existing prompt identified by its command.
- **Parameters**: Requires `token` for authorization, and the `command`, `title`, and `content` for the update.
- **Process**: Sends a POST request to `/prompts/command/{command}/update` with the updated data. If successful, it returns the updated prompt data; otherwise, it throws an error.

### deletePromptByCommand
- **Purpose**: Deletes a prompt based on its command.
- **Parameters**: Requires `token` for authorization and the `command` of the prompt to delete.
- **Process**: Sends a DELETE request to `/prompts/command/{command}/delete`. Returns a success message if the deletion is successful; otherwise, it throws an error.

### Error Handling
Each function has a try-catch block to handle any errors that occur during the fetch request. If an error is caught, it logs the error and rethrows it with the error detail. This is crucial for frontend applications where proper error handling can inform the user about what went wrong.

### Authentication
The `authorization` header in each request uses a Bearer token scheme for securing API access. This token must be provided by the frontend application, typically obtained after the user logs in, ensuring that only authorized users can perform operations on prompts.

### Usage
These functions are designed to be imported and used wherever prompt-related API calls are needed in the frontend application, abstracting away the details of constructing requests and handling responses.

## src/lib/apis/rag/index.ts

This TypeScript code defines a set of API client functions for interacting with a backend service related to document and query processing, likely part of a Retrieve and Generate (RAG) system. Each function is designed to perform specific operations like fetching parameters, updating settings, uploading documents, querying, and more. The code makes HTTP requests to the backend and handles responses, including error handling. Let's break down each function for a clearer understanding:

### `getChunkParams` Function
- **Purpose**: Fetches chunk parameters from the backend.
- **Process**: Makes a GET request to the `/chunk` endpoint. If the request fails, it catches the error, logs it, and assigns the error detail to a variable to throw later.

### `updateChunkParams` Function
- **Purpose**: Updates chunk size and overlap parameters.
- **Process**: Sends a POST request with the new size and overlap values to the `/chunk/update` endpoint. Error handling is similar to the `getChunkParams` function.

### `getRAGTemplate` Function

- **Process**: Sends a POST request with the new template to the `/template/update` endpoint, incorporating error handling similar to other functions.

### `uploadDocToVectorDB` Function
- **Purpose**: Uploads a document file to a vector database under a specified collection.
- **Process**: Prepares a FormData object with the file and collection name, sends a POST request to the `/doc` endpoint, and handles possible errors.

### `uploadWebToVectorDB` Function
- **Purpose**: Submits a web page URL to be stored in a vector database under a specific collection.
- **Process**: Sends a POST request with the URL and collection name to the `/web` endpoint. Error handling follows the established pattern.

### `queryDoc` Function
- **Purpose**: Submits a query against a specific document collection.
- **Process**: Sends a POST request with the collection name, query string, and the number of results (`k`) to consider. Errors are handled accordingly.

### `queryCollection` Function
- **Purpose**: Executes a query across multiple collections.
- **Process**: Similar to `queryDoc`, but targets multiple collections. Sends the collection names, query, and `k` in a POST request to the `/query/collection` endpoint.

### `scanDocs` Function
- **Purpose**: Retrieves a list of documents from the vector database.
- **Process**: Makes a GET request to the `/scan` endpoint to fetch the document list, including error handling.

### `resetVectorDB` Function
- **Purpose**: Resets or clears the vector database.
- **Process**: Sends a GET request to the `/reset` endpoint to clear the database, with standard error handling.

### Error Handling
Each function implements a pattern for error handling that involves catching errors from fetch requests, logging them, and optionally throwing a more specific error message. This is crucial for providing feedback to the user and for debugging.

### Authorization
Each function includes an `Authorization` header with a bearer token in the request. This indicates that the API endpoints are protected and require valid authentication tokens to access.

### General Workflow
The functions encapsulate the interactions with a specific set of backend endpoints, abstracting the complexity of HTTP requests and error handling into reusable functions. This modular approach improves code readability and maintainability, especially in larger projects where frontend components need to interact with backend services frequently.

By organizing the API interactions into a dedicated module (`index.ts` under a `rag` directory), the code separates concerns and makes it easier to update the API base URL, headers, or endpoints in one place without affecting the rest of the frontend application.


## src/lib/apis/users/index.ts

This TypeScript code is part of the frontend library that interacts with a backend API, specifically related to user management functionalities in a web application. It defines functions to perform API requests to get user permissions, update user permissions, update a user's role, fetch a list of users, delete a user by ID, and update user details. Each function utilizes the JavaScript Fetch API for making HTTP requests to the backend. Let's break down the key parts:

### Import Statement
- `WEBUI_API_BASE_URL` is imported from a constants file, likely holding the base URL for the backend API.

### getUserPermissions Function
- Fetches the current user's permissions from the backend using a `GET` request.
- Requires the user's authentication token.
- If the request fails, it logs the error and optionally throws it.

### updateUserPermissions Function
- Updates the permissions for the current user by sending a `POST` request with the new permissions in the request body.
- Also requires the user's authentication token.
- Similar error handling as the `getUserPermissions` function.

### updateUserRole Function
- Sends a `POST` request to update the role of a specific user identified by their ID.
- The user's new role is sent in the request body along with their ID.
- Uses the user's authentication token for authorization.

### getUsers Function
- Retrieves a list of all users via a `GET` request.
- Requires the user's authentication token.
- Returns an empty array if there's an error or if the response body is falsy.

### deleteUserById Function
- Deletes a specific user identified by their `userId` through a `DELETE` request.
- Requires the user's authentication token.
- Similar error handling as the previous functions.

### updateUserById Function
- Updates details for a specific user identified by their `userId`.
- Sends a `POST` request with the user's new details (like profile image URL, email, name, and optionally a new password) in the request body.
- Requires the user's authentication token.
- If the `password` field is an empty string, it's omitted from the request body.

### Common Patterns
- **Authorization**: Each function includes an `Authorization` header with a bearer token, ensuring that only authenticated users can perform these operations.
- **Error Handling**: Each function has a pattern of making a request, checking if the response is OK, parsing the JSON body, and handling errors by logging and throwing them.
- **Async/Await Syntax**: All functions are asynchronous, using `async`/`await` syntax for handling asynchronous operations like network requests.
- **Dynamic URLs**: Constructs request URLs dynamically using the `WEBUI_API_BASE_URL` constant and appending endpoints specific to each operation.
- **Conditional Throwing**: Errors are logged and stored in a variable; if an error is set, it gets thrown, allowing the calling code to handle it.

This code exemplifies a clean and consistent approach to interacting with a backend for user management tasks in a modern web application, leveraging TypeScript for added type safety and clarity.

## src/lib/apis/utils/index.ts

This TypeScript code snippet is part of a frontend application that interacts with a backend API to fetch Gravatar URLs for a given email. Let's break down the functionality and purpose of each part of the code:

### Import Statement
```typescript
import { WEBUI_API_BASE_URL } from '$lib/constants';
```
- This line imports the base URL for the backend API (`WEBUI_API_BASE_URL`) from a constants module. This base URL is used to make requests to the backend services. The `$lib` notation suggests this project is using SvelteKit, or a similar setup, where `$lib` is an alias to the `lib` directory.

### The `getGravatarUrl` Function
```typescript
export const getGravatarUrl = async (email: string) => {
```
- This function, `getGravatarUrl`, is an asynchronous function that takes an email address as its argument. It's responsible for fetching the Gravatar URL associated with the given email. The function is exported, meaning it can be imported and used in other parts of the frontend application.

### Making a Fetch Request
```typescript
const res = await fetch(`${WEBUI_API_BASE_URL}/utils/gravatar?email=${email}`, {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
})
```
- Here, a fetch request is made to the backend server to get the Gravatar URL. The request is constructed using the base URL, appending `/utils/gravatar` as the endpoint, and including the email as a query parameter. The `Content-Type` header is set to `application/json`, indicating that the server is expected to return JSON-formatted data.

### Handling the Response
```typescript
.then(async (res) => {
    if (!res.ok) throw await res.json();
    return res.json();
})
```
- After the fetch request is made, the `.then()` method handles the response. If the response is not OK (indicating an HTTP status code outside the 2xx success range), it throws an error with the response payload. Otherwise, it returns the JSON-parsed response body, which presumably contains the Gravatar URL.

### Catching Errors
```typescript
.catch((err) => {
    console.log(err);
    error = err;
    return null;
});
```
- The `.catch()` method catches any errors that occurred during the fetch request or in the `.then()` block. It logs the error to the console, assigns the error to a local `error` variable for potential future use, and returns `null` to indicate that no Gravatar URL could be retrieved due to the error.

### Return Statement
```typescript
return res;
```
- Finally, the function returns the result of the fetch operation. If successful, this will be the JSON-parsed response containing the Gravatar URL. If there was an error, it will return `null`.

### Summary
The `getGravatarUrl` function is designed to asynchronously fetch and return a Gravatar URL for a given email address by communicating with a specific endpoint on the backend server. It includes error handling to manage cases where the request fails or the server responds with an error. This utility function can be used anywhere within the frontend application that requires displaying user avatars based on their email addresses.


## src/lib/apis/index.ts

This TypeScript code snippet defines a set of asynchronous functions designed to communicate with a backend API from a frontend application. These functions are responsible for fetching configuration data, changelog information, and version updates from the backend. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

### Import Statement
- `import { WEBUI_BASE_URL } from '$lib/constants';`: This imports the base URL of the backend API from a constants file. This base URL is used to construct requests to the backend.

### `getBackendConfig` Function
- **Purpose**: Fetches the application's configuration from the backend.
- **Process**:
  - Constructs a request URL by appending `/api/config` to the `WEBUI_BASE_URL`.
  - Makes a `GET` request to the backend with `Content-Type: application/json` header.
  - If the response is not OK (`res.ok` is false), it throws the response's JSON content as an error.
  - Otherwise, it returns the JSON-parsed response, which contains the configuration data.

### `getChangelog` Function
- **Purpose**: Retrieves the application's changelog from the backend.
- **Process**:
  - Similar to `getBackendConfig`, but it appends `/api/changelog` to the `WEBUI_BASE_URL` and makes a request to fetch the changelog data.
  - Handles errors in the same way, throwing the parsed error response if the request fails, and returning the changelog data upon success.

### `getVersionUpdates` Function
- **Purpose**: Checks for version updates by fetching the latest version information from the backend.
- **Process**:
  - Constructs the request URL by appending `/api/version/updates` to the `WEBUI_BASE_URL`.
  - Follows the same error handling and data retrieval pattern as the previous functions, aiming to fetch and return version update information.

### Error Handling and Response Processing
- In each function, a `try-catch` pattern is used with the `fetch` API's Promise-based syntax:
  - The `.then()` method is used to handle the fetch response. It checks if the request was successful (`res.ok`). If not, it throws the response's JSON content, effectively rejecting the promise.
  - The `.catch()` method captures any errors thrown during the request or response processing, logging the error to the console and storing it in an `error` variable.
  - If an error occurred (`error` is not `null`), it throws the error, making it the caller's responsibility to handle it.
  - If no error occurred, it returns the parsed response data.

### Usage
These functions are designed to be used in a frontend application (e.g., a web app built with Svelte, React, or another JavaScript framework) to dynamically fetch and display backend-provided data such as application settings, changelog, and version updates. The functions use modern JavaScript's `async-await` syntax for asynchronous operations, making the code clean and easy to follow. They demonstrate a practical approach to API communication, error handling, and data processing in a frontend application context.

## src/lib/components/admin/Settings/General.svelte

This Svelte component, written in TypeScript, appears to be part of a web application's admin interface, specifically a settings page for general configurations. It interacts with a backend (likely a FastAPI server, given the backend code discussed earlier) to manage settings such as sign-up status, default user role, and JWT expiration duration. Let's break down its functionality:

### Script Section
- **Imports**: Functions from `$lib/apis/auths` are imported for fetching and updating settings related to authentication and authorization. `onMount` from Svelte is used to execute code when the component mounts.
- **Exported Props**: `saveHandler` is a function passed from a parent component, intended to be called when saving settings.
- **Local State Variables**: `signUpEnabled`, `defaultUserRole`, and `JWTExpiresIn` hold the current settings fetched from the backend and are bound to the UI for display and modification.
- **Functions**: 
  - `toggleSignUpEnabled` toggles the status of user sign-ups.
  - `updateDefaultUserRoleHandler` updates the default role assigned to new users.
  - `updateJWTExpiresDurationHandler` updates the expiration duration for JWT tokens.
  - These functions use the imported API utilities and `localStorage.token` for authentication with the backend.
- **onMount Lifecycle**: Fetches the current settings from the backend when the component mounts and updates local state variables.

### Form Section
- **Structure**: The form contains sections for enabling/disabling new user sign-ups, setting the default user role, and specifying JWT expiration duration. Each section uses bound variables to reflect and update the component's state based on user input.
- **Enable New Sign-Ups**: A toggle button updates `signUpEnabled` by calling `toggleSignUpEnabled`. It visually represents the current state with different SVG icons for enabled/disabled statuses.
- **Default User Role**: A dropdown (`select` element) allows the admin to choose between "Pending", "User", or "Admin" roles. Changes trigger `updateDefaultUserRoleHandler`.
- **JWT Expiration**: An input field where admins can specify the duration for which JWT tokens should remain valid. Valid units are provided as a hint to the admin.
- **Save Button**: Submits the form, calling `updateJWTExpiresDurationHandler` with the new JWT expiration value and then `saveHandler`.

### Functionality Summary
This component lets an admin configure general settings of the application:
- **Toggle Sign-Up Enabled Status**: Quickly enable or disable new user registrations.
- **Set Default User Role**: Decide what role new users should have by default when they sign up or are created.
- **Specify JWT Expiration Duration**: Determine how long authentication tokens remain valid, impacting how frequently users need to reauthenticate.

This component uses asynchronous operations to interact with the backend API, ensuring that changes are persisted across sessions and reflecting the current configuration state when the admin visits the settings page. It demonstrates a typical pattern in web development where front-end components use APIs to manage application settings dynamically.

## src/lib/components/admin/Settings/Users.svelte

This Svelte component, presumably part of an admin settings page, is designed for managing and updating user permissions, specifically focusing on the ability to allow or disallow chat deletion. The component makes use of Svelte's reactivity, TypeScript for typing, and APIs for fetching and updating settings. Let's break down the script and template sections for a clearer understanding.

### Script Section
- **Imports**: Functions for interacting with the backend API (`getSignUpEnabledStatus`, `toggleSignUpEnabledStatus`, `getUserPermissions`, `updateUserPermissions`) are imported, alongside Svelte's lifecycle function `onMount`.
- **Exported `saveHandler` Function**: A function passed as a prop to this component, likely intended to be called after saving the permissions to perform additional actions (e.g., showing a success message).
- **Local State `permissions`**: Initializes the `permissions` object, specifically for chat features like deletion, defaulting to allow deletion (`true`).
- **`onMount` Lifecycle Hook**: Fetches the current user permissions from the backend API upon component mount and updates the local `permissions` state. It uses the `localStorage.token` for authentication.

### Template (HTML) Section
The template consists of a form designed with Tailwind CSS for styling. It has the following main features:
- **User Permissions Section**: Displays a toggle for enabling or disabling chat deletion. The current state (`permissions.chat.deletion`) dictates the toggle's appearance and label.
    - **Toggle Button**: A button that toggles the `permissions.chat.deletion` boolean value. It uses an inline event handler for the click event. The button's label and icon change based on whether chat deletion is allowed or not, demonstrated by the use of Svelte's `{#if}` block.
    - **Icons**: SVG icons visually indicate the current state of chat deletion permission.
    - **Text**: Accompanying text changes between "Allow" and "Don't Allow" based on the current permission state.
- **Save Button**: When clicked (form submission), it prevents the default form submission behavior, updates the user permissions via the API using the `localStorage.token` for authentication, and then calls the `saveHandler()` function.

### Reactive Behavior and API Integration
The component dynamically updates its display based on the `permissions` state. It interacts with the backend through API calls to fetch and update permissions, making it a reactive, data-driven part of the admin interface.

### Tailwind CSS for Styling
The use of Tailwind CSS classes (`flex`, `justify-between`, `px-4`, `py-2`, etc.) facilitates responsive design and utility-first styling, ensuring the component is well-presented and functional across devices.

### Summary
This Svelte component is a practical example of creating interactive and dynamic UIs with Svelte, integrating API calls for real-time data fetching and updates, and leveraging Tailwind CSS for styling. It demonstrates key concepts like reactivity, lifecycle management, and asynchronous data handling in a Svelte application.


## src/lib/components/admin/EditUserModal.svelte

This Svelte component, `EditUserModal.svelte`, provides a user interface for editing user details within an admin dashboard, using a modal window for interaction. The component makes use of several libraries and Svelte features to achieve its functionality. Here's a detailed explanation:

### Script Section
- **Imports**: Libraries and functions are imported, including `toast` for notifications, `dayjs` for date formatting, `createEventDispatcher` for creating custom events, and `onMount` for running code when the component mounts. Additionally, `updateUserById` is imported from a custom API utility for updating user details, and `Modal` is a reusable modal component.
- **Variables and Props**:
  - `dispatch`: A dispatcher for creating and dispatching custom events.
  - `show`: A boolean prop to control the visibility of the modal.
  - `selectedUser` and `sessionUser`: Props representing the user being edited and the current session user, respectively.
  - `_user`: A local variable to hold a copy of the user's details, initialized with default values.
- **Functions**:
  - `submitHandler`: An asynchronous function that calls `updateUserById` to update the user's details in the backend. On success, it dispatches a 'save' event and hides the modal. Errors are shown using toast notifications.
  - `onMount`: A lifecycle hook that initializes `_user` with `selectedUser`'s details when the component mounts or the selected user changes.

### Modal Component
The `Modal` component is used to create the modal window. It is passed a `size` prop and bound to the `show` variable to control its visibility.

### HTML Structure
- The modal's content includes a section to display the selected user's profile image, name, and account creation date. This utilizes the `selectedUser` prop and formats the timestamp using `dayjs`.
- A form is provided for editing the user's email, name, and password. Input fields are bound to respective properties of `_user`, ensuring two-way data binding. The email field is disabled when editing the session user's own details to prevent changing one's own email.
- The form uses the `on:submit|preventDefault` directive to run `submitHandler` without reloading the page when submitted.
- Styling is applied to input elements to ensure a consistent look across different browsers and platforms. Some styles specifically target webkit browsers (Chrome, Safari) and Firefox for appearance adjustments.

### Styling
- The component includes styles to customize input fields, particularly to remove spin buttons from number inputs and to hide scrollbars from tabs in webkit-based browsers, Edge, and Firefox.

### Interactivity and Data Flow
- The modal leverages Svelte's reactivity to update user details in real-time as the admin edits fields. Upon submitting the form, it communicates with the backend to save these changes and updates the UI accordingly based on the operation's success or failure.

This component demonstrates a typical pattern for handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in Svelte applications, encapsulating both the UI and logic for updating a user's details in a modular and reusable way. It highlights Svelte's capabilities for building dynamic and interactive web applications with minimal boilerplate.


## src/lib/components/admin/SettingsModal.svelte

This Svelte component, `SettingsModal`, is designed to render a modal dialog in a web application's admin settings area, leveraging Svelte's reactivity and component system for a dynamic UI experience. It's built with the Svelte framework, which is known for its reactivity and compile-time optimizations. Here's a breakdown of its functionalities:

### Imports and Component Setup
- **Modal Import**: Imports a `Modal` component from a common components directory, which is likely a reusable modal dialog component.
- **General and Users Imports**: Imports two specific settings components, `General` and `Users`, which represent different sections of the admin settings that can be adjusted within the modal.
- **Exported Prop**: Exports a `show` prop, allowing parent components to control the visibility of the settings modal.
- **Local State**: Defines a local state variable `selectedTab` to keep track of which tab is currently selected (`'general'` or `'users'`).

### Modal Component as Wrapper
- The `<Modal>` component is used as a wrapper around the settings modal content, binding to the `show` prop so that the modal's visibility can be controlled externally.

### Modal Content Structure
- **Header**: Contains a title "Admin Settings" and a close button. The close button has an `on:click` event handler that sets `show` to `false`, effectively hiding the modal.
- **Tabs for Navigation**: Defines two tabs, "General" and "Users", each represented by a button. Clicking on a tab button updates `selectedTab` to the corresponding tab's identifier.
- **Tab Content Rendering**: Uses Svelte's `{#if}` block to conditionally render the content based on `selectedTab`. If `selectedTab` is `'general'`, the `<General>` component is rendered; if `selectedTab` is `'users'`, the `<Users>` component is rendered.

### SVG Icons
- Both the close button in the header and the icons for the "General" and "Users" tabs are represented using inline SVG elements. This provides vector-based, scalable icons that are directly embedded into the markup for quick loading and rendering.

### Styling and Responsiveness
- The component uses Tailwind CSS classes (indicated by `class="..."`) for styling and layout. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development with high customization capability. The modal uses flexbox utilities to achieve a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

### Reactive Statements and Event Handling
- Svelte's reactivity system ensures that changes to reactive variables (like `selectedTab` or `show`) automatically update the DOM. For instance, changing `selectedTab` updates the displayed tab content without additional code.
- Event handlers are attached directly to buttons for intuitive interaction logic, such as closing the modal or switching tabs.

### Summary
`SettingsModal` is a sophisticated yet elegantly structured Svelte component for rendering a modal with tabbed settings areas in an admin interface. By combining Svelte's reactive features, SVG for icons, and Tailwind CSS for styling, it creates a user-friendly and responsive settings dialog that can dynamically switch between different settings views based on user interaction.


## src/lib/components/chat/MessageInput/Documents.svelte

This Svelte component, `Documents.svelte`, is designed to provide an interactive document selection interface within a chat application. It integrates with a document store and allows users to filter and select documents or collections based on a text prompt. Here's a detailed breakdown of its functionality:

### Script Section
- **Imports**: The component imports necessary utilities and stores, including Svelte's `createEventDispatcher` for emitting custom events, a document store, utility functions, and third-party packages for UI feedback (`svelte-sonner` for toasts).

- **State Variables**:
  - `prompt`: A reactive prop that represents the current user input.
  - `selectedIdx`: Tracks the currently selected document or collection in the list.
  - `filteredItems`, `filteredDocs`, and `collections`: Arrays that store processed documents and collections for rendering based on the prompt.

- **Reactivity**:
  - Svelte's reactivity is used to update `collections`, `filteredCollections`, `filteredDocs`, and `filteredItems` whenever the `prompt` changes or the documents store updates. This includes compiling a unique list of tags from the documents and filtering both documents and collections to match the current prompt.

- **Event Dispatching**:
  - `dispatch`: A function created to dispatch custom events (like selecting a document) to parent components.

- **Selection Functions** (`selectUp`, `selectDown`, `confirmSelect`, `confirmSelectWeb`):
  - These functions handle keyboard or mouse interactions for navigating through and selecting from the filtered list of documents and web URLs.

### HTML Section
- The HTML part conditionally displays a list of filtered documents or collections based on the current `prompt`. If the prompt starts with an HTTP scheme, it suggests that the prompt may be a URL, offering a different interaction pattern.
- The list is rendered using a Svelte `#each` block, allowing users to click or hover over items to select them.
- A special case is handled for when the prompt appears to be a valid HTTP URL, offering the user to select this URL directly.
- CSS classes are used conditionally to highlight the currently selected item and adapt the theme for dark mode.

### Functionality in Detail
1. **Prompt Filtering**: As the user types a prompt, the component filters available documents and collections to match. This likely happens in a chat input where the user can reference documents or external URLs quickly.
2. **Document and Collection Selection**: The user can navigate through the filtered list using keyboard commands or mouse movements and select an item to reference in their chat message.
3. **Web URL Support**: If the user types a prompt resembling a URL, the component offers an option to confirm this URL, potentially for sharing web resources in the chat.
4. **Event Dispatching**: Upon selection, the component dispatches an event with the selected document or URL, which the parent component can handle to insert the reference into the chat input or perform another action.
5. **User Feedback**: The component interacts with the user through visual cues (highlighting selected items) and potentially through toasts for invalid URL inputs.

This component enhances user experience by seamlessly integrating document selection within a chat application, making it easier to reference documents or web pages in conversations.

## src/lib/components/chat/MessageInput/Models.svelte

This Svelte component is designed for handling user input in a chat application, specifically for selecting and using models to generate responses based on prompts. It integrates with an external API to generate these responses. Let's break down its functionality:

### Script Tag with TypeScript
The script section starts with `lang="ts"`, indicating it uses TypeScript for type safety and additional features over regular JavaScript.

### Imports
- Various utilities and stores are imported for handling API requests, managing application state, and utilities for text processing.
- `tick` from Svelte is imported for managing updates to the DOM after state changes.
- `toast` from `svelte-sonner` is used for displaying notifications or error messages to the user.

### Component Exports (Props)
- `prompt`, `user`, `chatInputPlaceholder`, and `messages` are declared as props, allowing them to be passed to this component from its parent. These handle the current prompt, user information, placeholder text for the chat input, and the array of chat messages, respectively.

### Local Variables
- `selectedIdx` and `filteredModels` are local state variables. `selectedIdx` tracks the currently selected model by index, and `filteredModels` stores models filtered based on the prompt.

### Reactive Statements
- Two reactive statements (`$:`) automatically update `filteredModels` based on the `prompt` value and reset `selectedIdx` when `prompt` changes. `filteredModels` filters models to exclude external ones and those not matching the initial part of the prompt, sorting them alphabetically by name.

### Model Selection Handlers
- `selectUp` and `selectDown` are methods for navigating the list of filtered models with keyboard or mouse input, updating the `selectedIdx` accordingly.

### confirmSelect Function
- This async function is the core of generating a response based on the selected model. It clears the current prompt, sets a placeholder indicating the model is "thinking," and focuses on the chat input element.
- It constructs the conversation text by accumulating messages and sends this data to the `generatePrompt` API function along with the selected model.
- It then processes the API response, updating the prompt with the generated response. It also handles potential API errors or connection issues, displaying relevant error messages using the `toast` utility.

### Component Markup
- The markup (`{#if filteredModels.length > 0}`) conditionally renders a selection interface if there are any filtered models available. It displays a list of selectable models as buttons, highlighting the currently selected model. Clicking a model button or moving the mouse over it updates the selection and potentially triggers the response generation.
- It uses Svelte's `{#each}` block to iterate over `filteredModels`, displaying each one in a button element. Events like `on:click` and `on:mousemove` are attached to each button for handling model selection and highlighting.

### Summary

## src/lib/components/chat/MessageInput/Suggestions.svelte

This Svelte component is designed for displaying a list of suggestion prompts in a chat interface, with functionality to submit a selected prompt. It's written in TypeScript (`<script lang="ts">`). Let's break down the code:

### Script Section
- **Variables**:
  - `submitPrompt`: An exported function that will likely be called when a user selects a suggestion. It's passed down from a parent component.
  - `suggestionPrompts`: An exported array of suggestions that this component will display. It's initially set to an empty array and is expected to be populated by a parent component.
  - `prompts`: A local variable to hold the prompts that will actually be displayed. This allows for manipulation or filtering of the `suggestionPrompts` without altering the original array.

- **Reactive Statement** (`$:`):
  - This part of the code dynamically determines which prompts to display based on the length of `suggestionPrompts`. If there are 4 or fewer prompts, it displays them all. If there are more than 4, it randomly sorts the array and slices it to get only 4 prompts. This ensures variety in the suggestions shown to the user while limiting the number to a manageable size.

### HTML Template Section
- The template displays the `prompts` using Svelte's `{#each}` block for iteration. Each prompt is rendered within a `<button>` element, allowing users to select a prompt by clicking on it.
- **Conditional Classes**:
  - For responsiveness, the class on each prompt's container `<div>` changes based on its index (`promptIdx`). If the index is greater than 1, the `hidden sm:inline-flex` class hides the prompt on small screens, showing only the first two prompts to mobile users.
- **Content Display**:
  - Inside each button, a conditional block (`{#if}`) checks if the prompt has a title. If so, it displays the title (split into two parts for styling) and the prompt content differently to enhance readability. If there's no title, it displays only the prompt content.
- **OnClick Event**:
  - The `on:click` event handler on the button calls the `submitPrompt` function with the prompt's content, signaling the selected prompt to be processed or displayed in the chat.
- **Styling**:
  - The buttons and their contents are styled for both light and dark themes, with classes controlling backgrounds, hover effects, text color, and spacing to ensure the suggestions are visually appealing and integrated with the rest of the chat interface.
- **Icon**:
  - Each button also features an SVG icon (an arrow pointing upwards), visually indicating that clicking the button will "submit" or "send" the prompt.

### Summary
This Svelte component offers an interactive way for users to quickly select from a set of suggestions within a chat application. It enhances user experience by providing helpful prompts, making chat interactions more engaging and efficient. The component is designed to be both responsive and adaptable to theme changes, ensuring a consistent look and feel across different devices and preferences.


## src/lib/components/chat/Messages/CodeBlock.svelte


This Svelte component, named `CodeBlock`, is designed to display code snippets within a UI, offering syntax highlighting and a copy-to-clipboard feature. It's built with Svelte, a modern frontend compiler that enables creating highly reactive and efficient web apps. Let's break down the code:

### Script Tag with TypeScript
- The script is written in TypeScript (`<script lang="ts">`), offering static type checking over standard JavaScript.
- It imports a utility function `copyToClipboard` from a local utilities module, allowing the text to be copied to the user's clipboard.
- The `highlight.js` library is imported for syntax highlighting of code snippets. This library supports many programming languages and styles.
- A specific `highlight.js` style sheet (`github-dark.min.css`) is included to style the highlighted code.

### Component Props
- Two props, `lang` (language of the code snippet) and `code` (the code text itself), are defined with `export let`. This allows parent components to pass data to `CodeBlock`.

### Local State and Functions
- A local boolean variable `copied` is used to track if the code has been copied to the clipboard.
- `copyCode` is an asynchronous function that sets `copied` to `true`, calls the `copyToClipboard` utility with the current `code`, and after a timeout of 1 second, sets `copied` back to `false`. This provides user feedback indicating that the code has been copied.

### Reactive Statement
- A reactive statement (`$:`) calculates `highlightedCode` based on the current `code` and `lang` props. If `code` is present, it uses `highlight.js` to auto-highlight the code. If a specific language is provided and recognized, it attempts to use the provided language's aliases for highlighting; otherwise, it defaults to auto-detection. The result is the HTML markup for the highlighted code.

### HTML Template
- The template conditionally renders (`{#if code}`) if there's code to display.
- It structures the code block within a `div`, with a sub-div containing the language label and a "Copy Code" button. The button text toggles between "Copy Code" and "Copied" based on the `copied` state, providing feedback when the code is copied.
- An `on:click` handler is attached to the button to trigger `copyCode` when clicked.
- The actual code snippet is wrapped in a `<pre>` and `<code>` tag, where the `highlightedCode` (or fallback to `code` if highlighting fails) is rendered as HTML using the `@html` directive. This allows `highlight.js`'s markup to be properly rendered in the browser.
- The `class` attributes on the elements use TailwindCSS utility classes for styling, specifying colors, padding, text sizes, and overflow behaviors. The use of classes like `bg-[#202123]` and `text-white` directly sets the background and text colors, ensuring the code block fits well with a dark-themed UI.

### Summary
This `CodeBlock` component effectively combines functionality and aesthetics for displaying code snippets in a web application. It utilizes `highlight.js` for syntax highlighting, making code easier to read and understand. The copy-to-clipboard feature enhances usability by allowing users to quickly copy code snippets with a single click, receiving immediate visual feedback. TailwindCSS and custom styles ensure that the presentation of the code block is visually appealing and consistent with the application's design.


## src/lib/components/chat/Messages/Placeholder.svelte


This Svelte component is designed to display a placeholder with selectable models or modelfiles in a chat UI, typically when initializing or in between interactions. Here's a breakdown of its parts and functionalities:

### Script Tag with TypeScript
- **Imports**: The script imports `WEBUI_BASE_URL` from constants, the `user` store to access user data, and `onMount` from Svelte for lifecycle management.
- **Exported Props**: `models` and `modelfiles` are arrays passed into this component, presumably containing information about available models and their files.
- **Local Variables**:
  - `modelfile`: Holds the current selected model file information.
  - `selectedModelIdx`: Tracks the index of the currently selected model within the `models` array.
- **Reactive Statements**:
  - The first `$:` block dynamically assigns a modelfile based on the selected model index and checks if the selected model exists within the `modelfiles`. If so, it assigns the corresponding modelfile; otherwise, it assigns `null`.
  - The second `$:` block updates the `selectedModelIdx` to the last index in the `models` array whenever the `models` array changes (and has at least one entry).

### HTML Template
- The template checks if there are any models with `{#if models.length > 0}`. If there are models, it proceeds to display them.
- Inside a centered div, there's a flex container for model buttons. Each model in the `models` array is iterated over with `{#each models as model, modelIdx}`, creating a button for each one.
  - **Model Buttons**: On click, each button sets `selectedModelIdx` to its index. The button displays an image for the modelfile if available; otherwise, it defaults to a generic favicon.
- **Model Information Display**:
  - If a `modelfile` is selected (not `null`), it displays the modelfile's title and description. If the modelfile is associated with a user, it also provides a link to the user's profile.
  - If no modelfile is selected, it greets the logged-in user and asks how it can help, demonstrating a user-friendly and dynamic interaction.

### Styling and UX Considerations
- **Images** are styled with classes to be rounded, bordered, and of a fixed width, enhancing the visual appeal.
- **Conditional Rendering**: The component dynamically changes its content based on the `modelfile` selection and the `models` array length, ensuring an interactive and responsive user experience.
- **Accessibility**: Uses `alt` attributes for images and `draggable="false"` to improve accessibility and prevent unwanted drag actions.

### Summary
This Svelte component is part of a chat interface, likely for an application that allows users to interact with various AI models or services. It provides a user-friendly way to select different models before initiating interactions, enhancing the chat experience with visual cues and dynamic content based on the user's selections and available models.

This Svelte component, presumably part of a chat application's frontend, represents a user message. It's designed with functionality to display the message, allow editing and deleting, and handle associated actions such as showing previous or next messages. Let's break down the script and the markup:

### Script Tag:
- **Imports**: Uses `dayjs` for date formatting, Svelte's `tick` and `createEventDispatcher` for lifecycle and event management, and components `Name` and `ProfileImage` for displaying user details. It also imports `modelfiles` and `settings` stores.
- **Variables**: Declares props passed to the component (`user`, `message`, etc.), local state variables (`edit`, `editedContent`), and functions (`confirmEditMessage`, `showPreviousMessage`, etc.).
- **Event Handlers**: Functions like `editMessageHandler` and `editMessageConfirmHandler` are defined to handle user interactions, such as initiating message edit, confirming the edit, and canceling the edit process. There's also a `deleteMessageHandler` to dispatch an event for message deletion.

### Markup:
- **Profile Image**: Displays the user's profile image. If the message has a specific user, it tries to find the corresponding `modelfile` for the image; otherwise, it falls back to the `user` prop or a default image.
- **User Name and Timestamp**: Uses the `Name` component to display the user's name or identifier along with the message timestamp, formatted with `dayjs`.
- **Message Content**: 
  - For files attached to the message, it iterates over `message.files`, displaying images directly and providing buttons for documents or collections with options to open or interact with the file.
  - If the message is being edited (`edit === true`), it shows a `textarea` for editing the content. It also provides "Save & Submit" and "Cancel" buttons to control the editing process.
  - Otherwise, it displays the message content within a `<pre>` tag and shows action buttons on hover, allowing the user to edit, copy the message to the clipboard, or delete the message. It handles navigation between sibling messages if any.
  
### Key Features:
- **Responsive Edit Area**: Adjusts the height of the editing `textarea` dynamically to fit the content.

This Svelte component provides a user interface for updating a password. It's designed with TypeScript (`<script lang="ts">`) and leverages the Svelte framework's reactivity and component system. The code integrates user interactions, API calls, and feedback mechanisms using toasts for notifications. Let's break down its key parts:

### Imports and State Variables
- **Imports**: The component imports `toast` for showing notifications and `updateUserPassword` for making an API call to update the password.
- **State Variables**: `show`, `currentPassword`, `newPassword`, and `newPasswordConfirm` are used to control the visibility of the password fields and store the values entered by the user.

### Update Password Handler
- **`updatePasswordHandler` Function**: This asynchronous function checks if the new password and confirmation password match. If they do, it attempts to update the user's password by calling `updateUserPassword`, passing in the user's token, current password, and new password. It handles success and error cases with toast notifications and resets the password fields after an attempt.

### Form and Interaction
- The form uses the `on:submit` event to call `updatePasswordHandler` while preventing the default form submission behavior with `|preventDefault`.
- A button toggles the visibility of the password change form (`show` variable). This enhances user experience by not overwhelming the user with options or cluttering the UI unnecessarily.
- The form conditionally renders (`{#if show}`) the password input fields based on the `show` state, allowing users to enter their current password and choose a new password.
- Input fields are bound to their respective state variables using `bind:value`, ensuring that the component state updates with user input.
- The `autocomplete` attributes on the input fields enhance usability by providing appropriate suggestions or stored values for each field.
- A submit button at the end of the form allows the user to submit their new password once all fields are filled.

### Styling
- The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, providing a responsive and modern look. Classes like `text-sm`, `py-2`, `px-4`, and utility classes for colors (`text-gray-500`, `bg-gray-800`, etc.) are used to style the form and its elements.
- The use of conditional classes (`{show ? 'Hide' : 'Show'}`) for the toggle button text demonstrates Svelte's reactivity, changing the button label based on the `show` variable's state.

### Summary
This Svelte component offers a secure and user-friendly interface for updating passwords, incorporating input validation, user feedback, and conditional rendering for a clean user experience. It demonstrates Svelte's capabilities in handling form data, asynchronous operations, and conditional UI rendering, all while maintaining a concise and readable codebase.

## src/lib/components/chat/Settings/Advanced/AdvancedParams.svelte

This code is a Svelte component named `AdvancedParams.svelte`, written in TypeScript (`<script lang="ts">`). It's designed for a web application's chat settings, specifically for configuring advanced parameters of an AI model or chatbot. The component allows users to customize several options like seed, stop sequence, temperature, and more through a user interface.

### Script Tag
In the `<script>` section, there's an `options` object that initializes default values for various advanced parameters:
- `seed`: A number that initializes random number generation, affecting the randomness of responses.
- `stop`: A stop sequence to signal the end of a response.
- `temperature`: Controls randomness in prediction. Lower values make responses more predictable.
- `repeat_penalty`, `repeat_last_n`, `mirostat`, `mirostat_eta`, `mirostat_tau`, `top_k`, `top_p`, `tfs_z`, `num_ctx`, `num_predict`: These are various advanced parameters that can influence the model's response generation. Each parameter serves a specific purpose, like controlling repetition, influencing the selection of top predictions, adjusting the model's behavior, and defining the context and prediction lengths.

### HTML Structure
The HTML section is divided into several `<div>` blocks, each representing a UI control for one of the advanced parameters. The UI controls are primarily `<input>` elements allowing the user to enter or adjust values. The inputs are of two main types: numeric inputs and range sliders, providing a user-friendly way to configure the parameters.

- **Numeric Inputs**: Allow users to enter specific numeric values for parameters like seed, temperature, etc.
- **Range Sliders**: Provide a visual and interactive way to select values within a defined range, enhancing the user experience by allowing smooth adjustments.

### Dynamic UI Elements
The component employs Svelte's reactive features (`bind:value`) to bind input fields directly to the `options` object properties. This binding ensures that the object's state is updated in real time as the user interacts with the UI.

Buttons next to some fields toggle between default and custom values, demonstrating a practical use of conditional rendering in Svelte (`{#if ...}{:else}{/if}`). This feature allows users to quickly switch between using a predefined default setting and specifying a custom value, enhancing usability.

### CSS Classes
The component uses Tailwind CSS for styling, as indicated by classes like `rounded`, `py-1.5`, `px-4`, etc. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development by providing a vast number of utility classes to style elements directly within the HTML.

### Accessibility and UX
The component focuses on user experience (UX) and accessibility by incorporating labels, placeholders, and intuitive controls like sliders. The design choices, such as spacing (`space-y-3`), text sizes (`text-xs`), and dark mode support (`dark:text-gray-300`, `dark:bg-gray-800`), suggest a consideration for a modern, responsive, and accessible UI.

### Summary
`AdvancedParams.svelte` is a Svelte component designed for adjusting advanced chat or AI model settings within a web application. It showcases Svelte's reactivity, conditional rendering, and integration with Tailwind CSS for styling. This component would be part of a larger application, likely aimed at users who need fine-grained control over the behavior of chatbots or AI models.

## src/lib/components/chat/Settings/Account.svelte


This Svelte component, `Account.svelte`, is part of a web application's chat feature, specifically for managing user account settings. The component allows users to update their profile image and name, and provides an option to use a Gravatar image. Additionally, it includes functionality to reveal a JWT token and copy it to the clipboard. Let's break down the script and the template sections:

### Script Section (TypeScript)

- **Imports**: The script imports various utilities, components, and stores. For instance, `toast` from `svelte-sonner` for showing notifications, `onMount` lifecycle method from Svelte, user-related stores, and API calls.
- **Component Bindings**: It declares `saveHandler`, a function prop passed from a parent component, to handle saving actions.
- **Local State Variables**: Defines local state variables such as `profileImageUrl`, `name`, `showJWTToken`, and `JWTTokenCopied` for managing the UI state.
- **`submitHandler` Function**: An asynchronous function that calls `updateUserProfile` API with the user's token, name, and profile image URL. On success, it updates the user store with the new user data.
- **`onMount` Lifecycle Method**: When the component mounts, it initializes `name` and `profileImageUrl` with values from the user store.

### Template Section (HTML)

- **Profile Image Update**: Includes an `input` of type `file` to allow users to select a new profile image. It's hidden by default and programmatically clicked when the user wants to change their image. The file selection triggers an event handler that reads the file, compresses it (if it's an image), and updates the `profileImageUrl`.
- **Profile Details**: Provides input fields for updating the user's name. It binds to the `name` variable.
- **Update Password Component**: Incorporates the `UpdatePassword` component allowing users to change their password.
- **JWT Token Display**: Offers a toggleable input that displays the user's JWT token. It includes a copy to clipboard functionality.
- **Save Button**: A button to submit the updates. On click, it calls `submitHandler` and, on success, invokes `saveHandler` to potentially notify a parent component about the save action.

### Functionality in Detail

- **Profile Image Processing**: When a new profile image is selected, the component reads the file using `FileReader`, then compresses and resizes the image using a canvas. The result is a base64-encoded URL of the compressed image, which is then set as `profileImageUrl`.
- **Use Gravatar**: A button fetches a Gravatar URL based on the user's email and sets it as the profile image.
- **Copy JWT Token**: A button toggles the visibility of the JWT token and allows the user to copy it to the clipboard. Feedback is provided using a checkmark icon and a temporary state variable `JWTTokenCopied`.

### Design Considerations

- The component uses utility functions like `copyToClipboard` and API calls for fetching the Gravatar URL and updating the user profile, abstracting away complex logic from the component itself.
- It demonstrates good practices in Svelte for handling user inputs, managing asynchronous actions, and integrating with external APIs.
- The UI is built with responsiveness in mind, using TailwindCSS classes for styling and layout, making it adaptable to different screen sizes.

- Selected models are validated and can be saved as defaults in the local settings. If the user is an admin, these defaults can also be saved globally.
- The component is interactive, with immediate feedback provided through toasts and the ability to modify the selection dynamically.

This Svelte component demonstrates how to create dynamic, user-interactive forms in a Svelte application, utilizing reactive statements for real-time UI updates and asynchronous functions for handling data persistence.

## src/lib/components/chat/SettingsModal.svelte

This Svelte component, `SettingsModel.svelte`, appears to serve as a comprehensive settings modal for a chat application. It's structured with TypeScript (`<script lang="ts">`) and incorporates multiple smaller components for different settings categories. Let's break down the key parts:

### Script Tag
- **Imports**: The script starts by importing necessary libraries, Svelte stores, and API methods. It also imports various settings components like `Account`, `About`, `Models`, etc., which are presumably different sections of the settings modal.
- **Component State**: The `show` export controls the visibility of the modal. The `selectedTab` variable keeps track of which settings category is currently selected.
- **Function `saveSettings`**: This async function updates the `settings` store with new settings and saves them to `localStorage`. It also refreshes the `models` store by fetching updated models.
- **Function `getModels`**: Fetches model information from various APIs (`getOllamaModels`, `getOpenAIModels`, `getLiteLLMModels`) and formats them for use in the UI. It gracefully handles API errors and merges the results, interspersing horizontal rules (`{ name: 'hr' }`) between different model sources.

### HTML Structure
The HTML part of the component is wrapped in a `Modal` component, suggesting that this settings modal can be dynamically shown or hidden based on user interaction.

- **Header**: Contains a title ("Settings") and a close button that sets the `show` variable to false, closing the modal.
- **Tabs**: A list of buttons acting as tabs for different settings sections. Clicking a button updates `selectedTab` to show the corresponding section. Tabs are conditionally rendered based on the user's role, suggesting some settings are only available to admins.
- **Tab Content**: Conditionally renders the content based on the value of `selectedTab`. Each tab corresponds to a different settings component like `General`, `Models`, `Connections`, etc.

### Styling
The `<style>` tag includes styles to customize the appearance of inputs, hide scrollbars on the tabs container, and ensure a consistent look across different browsers and platforms.

### Summary
This component serves as a central location for managing application settings within a modal interface. It allows users (and administrators, for certain sections) to configure various aspects of the chat application, such as account details, app appearance, model configurations, and more. The use of dynamic imports for setting components keeps the modal's structure flexible and maintainable, while the async functions for saving settings and fetching models ensure that the UI stays responsive and up-to-date with the backend state.


## src/lib/components/chat/ShareChatModal.svelte

This Svelte component, `ShareChatModal`, is designed to provide users with a modal dialog that offers options to share a chat to the OpenWebUI Community or download it as a file. It uses the Svelte framework, a modern tool for building web applications with a component-based architecture. Let's break down the code to understand its functionality and structure:

### Script Tag with TypeScript
The `<script lang="ts">` tag indicates that the script content is written in TypeScript, an extension of JavaScript that adds static types. TypeScript enhances code quality and readability, especially for complex components.

### Imports
- `Modal` is imported from `../common/Modal.svelte`. This suggests that `ShareChatModal` uses a common modal dialog component for its UI, making the modal reusable and maintaining consistency across the app.

### Exports (Props)
- `downloadChat` and `shareChat` are functions passed to this component, likely callbacks that handle the respective actions of downloading and sharing a chat.
- `show` is a boolean indicating whether the modal should be displayed or not. It's exported to allow parent components to control the visibility of this modal.

### Modal Component
- The `<Modal bind:show size="xs">` uses the `bind:show` directive to create a two-way binding on the `show` prop, meaning changes to this variable inside the modal will reflect outside and vice versa. The `size="xs"` prop likely controls the size of the modal, setting it to extra-small.

### Modal Content
- Inside the modal, there's a `<div>` element structured to display the content in a column, with padding and width styles applied for consistent spacing and sizing.
- The first `<button>` allows users to share the chat to the OpenWebUI Community. Clicking this button triggers the `shareChat()` function and sets `show` to `false`, closing the modal.
    - Styling is applied to make the button visually appealing and indicative of its action (e.g., blue background, rounded corners).
- The "or" text is styled and placed between the two buttons to visually separate the sharing and downloading options.
- The second `<button>` offers the option to download the chat as a file. Similar to the share button, clicking this triggers the `downloadChat()` function and closes the modal by setting `show` to `false`.
    - This button is styled differently, likely to denote a secondary action, with text formatting instead of a solid background.

### Styling
- The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling (`px-`, `py-`, `w-full`, `rounded-full`, `text-sm`, etc.), a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development directly in markup.
- There's a mix of utility classes for padding, margins, font sizes, colors, and more, aimed at creating a responsive and aesthetically pleasing modal. The use of `dark:text-gray-500` suggests the app supports a dark mode, adjusting the text color accordingly.

### Summary
`ShareChatModal` is a Svelte component that provides a user interface for sharing or downloading a chat. It demonstrates effective use of component composition, TypeScript for props definition and logic, two-way binding for reactive UI updates, and utility-first CSS for styling. This component exemplifies how modern web development practices and tools like Svelte and Tailwind CSS can be used to build interactive and responsive UI components efficiently.

## src/lib/components/chat/ShortcutsModal.svelte


This Svelte component is designed to display a modal window that lists keyboard shortcuts for users. It's written using Svelte with TypeScript enhancements, showcasing the component-based architecture of Svelte for building interactive user interfaces. Let's break down the key parts of this code:

### Script Tag with TypeScript
- `import Modal from '../common/Modal.svelte';`: Imports a `Modal` component, which is a common modal dialog component likely reusable across the application.
- `export let show = false;`: Exports a reactive variable `show`, which controls the visibility of the shortcuts modal. Its initial value is `false`, indicating that the modal is hidden by default.

### The Modal Component
- `<Modal bind:show>`: Uses the `Modal` component and binds the `show` variable to the `show` prop of the `Modal`. This two-way binding ensures that changes to `show` inside the `Modal` component reflect back to this parent component, allowing the modal to control its visibility through user actions.

### Close Button
- A button with an SVG icon is used to close the modal. The `on:click` event is set to update the `show` variable to `false`, hiding the modal.
- The SVG itself is a simple "X" icon, commonly used for close actions in user interfaces.

### Content Structure
- The modal's content is divided into sections using `div` elements, with styling applied for layout and appearance. It utilizes Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `flex`, `justify-between`) for styling, indicating a utility-first CSS framework is used for styling the application.
- There are multiple sections, each displaying a particular keyboard shortcut. Each shortcut description includes the action it performs (e.g., "Open new chat", "Focus chat input") and the key combination (represented as individual keycaps).

### Keyboard Shortcuts Representation
- The keyboard shortcuts are displayed with visual keycaps, showing the actual keys to be pressed (e.g., `Ctrl/⌘`, `Shift`, `O`). This visual representation aids user comprehension of the shortcuts.
- For different operating systems, the `Ctrl/⌘` notation indicates that either the `Ctrl` key (Windows/Linux) or the `⌘` (Command) key (macOS) should be used, reflecting the component's cross-platform usability.

### Styling
- The component includes styles to customize the appearance of certain elements, like removing the spin button from number inputs and customizing scrollbars within the component to be invisible. These styles enhance the user interface by removing unnecessary elements and ensuring consistency across different browsers.

### Summary
The `ShortcutsModal.svelte` component is a user-friendly way to inform users about available keyboard shortcuts within the application, enhancing the user experience by providing quick access to common actions. The use of a modal for this purpose allows for an unobtrusive way to present this information, which users can easily dismiss. The component's structure and styling are carefully designed to make the information clear and accessible, while the implementation demonstrates effective use of Svelte's reactivity and component composition capabilities.

## src/lib/components/common/Tags/TagInput.svelte

This Svelte component, `TagInput.svelte`, provides functionality for inputting and submitting tags within a user interface. Svelte is a modern JavaScript compiler that generates efficient JavaScript code for creating reactive web interfaces with less boilerplate code. Let's break down the code:

### Script Section (TypeScript)
- **Imports**: The `createEventDispatcher` function is imported from Svelte, allowing the component to dispatch custom events.
- **Variables**:
  - `showTagInput`: A boolean that controls the visibility of the tag input field. It's initially set to `false`.
  - `tagName`: A string that holds the value entered into the tag input field. It starts as an empty string.

### HTML Template
The template uses Svelte's reactive syntax to dynamically update the UI based on the component's state.

- **Conditional Rendering**: The `{#if showTagInput}` block checks if `showTagInput` is true. If so, it renders the tag input field and a button to submit the tag.
- **Tag Input Field**:
  - An `<input>` element bound to `tagName`, capturing the user's input. Its appearance is styled to fit the design (e.g., `bg-transparent`, `outline-none`).
  - A placeholder text "Add a tag" is shown.
- **Submit Button**:
  - A button that, when clicked, dispatches an 'add' event with `tagName` as the payload, allowing parent components to listen for this event and react accordingly.
  - The button also resets `tagName` to an empty string and hides the input field by setting `showTagInput` to `false`.
  - It includes an SVG icon representing the action.
  
- **Toggle Tag Input Button**: Another button outside the `{#if}` block, which toggles the visibility of the tag input field. Clicking this button inverses the value of `showTagInput`.
  - It also includes an SVG icon, which visually indicates the action (add). The icon rotates 45 degrees when `showTagInput` is true, thanks to a conditional class (`{showTagInput ? 'rotate-45' : ''}`), visually signaling that the input is active or will close upon clicking.

### Styling and Interactivity
- The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling. Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development by applying classes directly in the markup.
- The transition effect (`transition-all transform`) for the toggle icon provides a smooth visual cue to the user when the input field is shown or hidden.

### Summary
This `TagInput.svelte` component is designed to offer a user-friendly way to add tags within an application. It emphasizes interactivity and visual feedback (e.g., rotating icons, input toggling) to enhance the user experience. When a tag is submitted, the component informs parent components of the action, allowing the application to update its state or UI accordingly. This pattern of component communication and state management is central to developing interactive web applications with Svelte.

## src/lib/components/common/Tags/TagList.svelte

This Svelte component, `TagList.svelte`, is designed to display a list of tags and allow users to delete a tag by clicking a button associated with each tag. Let's break down the code for better understanding:

### Script Block
- **Imports**: The component imports `createEventDispatcher` from Svelte, a utility function that allows the component to dispatch custom events.
- **Event Dispatcher Initialization**: Initializes `dispatch`, an instance of the event dispatcher.
- **Exported Property**: `tags` is declared as an exported variable, meaning it can receive its value as a prop from a parent component. It's initialized as an empty array, indicating that `tags` is expected to be an array of tag objects.

### HTML Template
- **Tags Iteration**: The `{#each ...}` block iterates over the `tags` array. For each `tag` in `tags`, Svelte renders the HTML markup inside the block.
- **Tag Container**: A `<div>` element serves as a container for each tag. It uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, applying padding, margin, flexbox utilities, rounded borders, and transition effects. The `dark:` classes apply styles when the user prefers a dark color scheme.
- **Tag Name Display**: Inside the container, another `<div>` displays the tag's name (`{tag.name}`). It also uses Tailwind CSS for styling, setting the text size, font weight, and ensuring the text is confined to a single line (`line-clamp-1`).
- **Delete Button**: A `<button>` element allows users to delete the tag. Clicking the button triggers an event handler that dispatches a custom event named `'delete'` with the tag's name as its payload. The button contains an SVG icon representing a cross or delete icon, styled with Tailwind CSS and the `fill="currentColor"` attribute to ensure the icon inherits the current text color.

### Functionality
- **Custom Event Dispatching**: When the delete button is clicked, the component dispatches a `'delete'` event with the tag's name as the detail. Parent components can listen to this event and implement the logic to remove the tag from the list, potentially involving updating state or making API calls to a backend server.

### Styling
- The component heavily relies on Tailwind CSS for styling, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development by applying utility classes directly in the markup.

### Usage
- This component can be used in any Svelte application where tags are part of the UI, such as a blog platform, a project management tool, or any system that categorizes items using tags. It enhances user interaction by allowing users to manage (specifically, delete) tags dynamically.

### Integration
- To integrate this component within a parent component and respond to the `delete` event, the parent would use something like `<TagList tags={...} on:delete={handleDelete} />`, where `handleDelete` is a function defined in the parent component to update the tags list accordingly.


## src/lib/components/common/Checkbox.svelte


This Svelte component is a custom checkbox implemented with a `<button>` element and SVG icons to visually indicate its state: checked, unchecked, or indeterminate. The component is written in TypeScript (`<script lang="ts">`), enhancing its reliability with static typing.

### Script Tag
- **Imports**: It imports `createEventDispatcher` from Svelte to allow the component to dispatch custom events. This is useful for parent components to listen and react to changes.
- **Variables**:
  - `state`: An exported variable that tracks the checkbox's state (`'unchecked'`, `'checked'`, or potentially `'indeterminate'` if set externally). It's initialized to `'unchecked'`.
  - `indeterminate`: An exported boolean indicating whether the checkbox is in an indeterminate state, meaning it's neither fully checked nor unchecked. This is useful for scenarios like multiple selection lists where only some items are selected.
  - `_state`: A local replica of `state` used to manage the checkbox's internal state.

- **Reactive Statement**: `$: _state = state;` ensures that any external change to `state` is reflected internally, keeping `_state` in sync.

### Button Element
- **Classes**: Uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The classes change based on the component's state to visually differentiate between checked, unchecked, and hovered states.
- **Click Event**: Defines behavior for toggling the checkbox's state. It toggles `_state` between `'unchecked'` and `'checked'`, dispatching a `'change'` event with the new state. If `indeterminate` is true and the checkbox is clicked, it sets `_state` to `'checked'` and dispatches the `'change'` event.

### Conditional Rendering
- **Checked State**: If `_state` is `'checked'`, it displays an SVG of a tick mark.
- **Indeterminate State**: If `indeterminate` is true, it shows a different SVG indicating an indeterminate state (a horizontal line).
- These SVG icons provide a visual indication of the checkbox's state, enhancing user experience.

### Usage and Communication
- When the button is clicked, it toggles between states and uses the `dispatch` function to emit a `change` event, notifying parent components of the state change. This allows for reactive behavior in applications, where the state of this checkbox can influence other components or logic.
- The component can be controlled both internally (via clicks) and externally (by setting the `state` and `indeterminate` props), making it flexible for various use cases.

### Summary
This Svelte component provides a customizable checkbox experience beyond the default HTML checkbox, with added visual feedback for an indeterminate state and full control over styling using Tailwind CSS. It's an example of creating more complex, interactive UI elements with Svelte while maintaining reactivity and accessibility.

## src/lib/components/common/Image.svelte

This code snippet defines a Svelte component named `Image.svelte` that incorporates an image element with a preview feature. Svelte is a modern frontend framework that allows you to build high-performance user interfaces with less boilerplate code. Let's break down the code piece by piece:

### Script Tag with TypeScript
The `<script lang="ts">` tag indicates that the script content is written in TypeScript, an extension of JavaScript that adds static types. TypeScript is used here for its benefits in type checking and code autocompletion, enhancing development efficiency and reducing runtime errors.

### Imports
- `import ImagePreview from './ImagePreview.svelte';` imports another Svelte component named `ImagePreview`. This component is presumably responsible for displaying an image preview, though its implementation details aren't shown here.

### Component Props
- `export let src = '';` declares a reactive prop named `src` for the component, intended to hold the source URL of the image. It's initialized to an empty string. Being `export`ed makes `src` a property that can be passed in when the component is used.
- `export let alt = '';` similarly declares an `alt` prop for the image's alternative text, useful for accessibility and SEO.

### Local State
- `let showImagePreview = false;` initializes a local state variable that controls whether the `ImagePreview` component should be visible. It starts as `false`, meaning the preview is hidden by default.

### Template
The template part of the component (the HTML-like syntax within the Svelte file) defines the UI structure:

- `<ImagePreview bind:show={showImagePreview} {src} {alt} />` uses the `ImagePreview` component and binds three props to it:
    - `bind:show={showImagePreview}` binds the `show` prop of `ImagePreview` to the local `showImagePreview` variable. This two-way binding means that if `show` changes inside `ImagePreview`, it will update `showImagePreview` in this component, and vice versa.
    - `{src}` and `{alt}` are shorthand for `src={src}` and `alt={alt}`, passing the `src` and `alt` props through to `ImagePreview`.

- The `<button>` element contains an `<img>` tag and is used to trigger the image preview. The button does not display traditional button content but instead shows the image directly.
    - `on:click={() => showImagePreview = true;}` attaches a click event listener to the button. When the button is clicked, it sets `showImagePreview` to `true`, which, due to the binding, will cause the `ImagePreview` component to become visible.
    - `<img {src} {alt} class=" max-h-96 rounded-lg" draggable="false" />` displays the image itself with the provided `src` and `alt` attributes. The image has a maximum height (`max-h-96`), rounded corners (`rounded-lg`), and is not draggable (`draggable="false"`), enhancing the user experience.

### Summary
This Svelte component presents an image that users can click to trigger a larger preview, possibly in a modal or overlay. It's a common pattern in web applications for enhancing the viewing experience of images, such as in galleries or product detail pages. The component is designed to be reusable, allowing developers to easily include image previews in various parts of an application by simply passing the appropriate `src` and `alt` props.

## src/lib/components/common/ImagePreview.svelte

This Svelte component is designed to create an image preview modal that can be shown or hidden dynamically and offers options to close the modal or download the displayed image. It's built with Svelte, a modern frontend compiler that allows you to build high-performance user interfaces with less code. Let's break down the key parts of this component:

### Script Block
- **Exports**: The component accepts three props:
  - `show`: A boolean to control the visibility of the image preview modal.
  - `src`: A string containing the source URL of the image to display.
  - `alt`: A string providing alternate text for the image, which is useful for accessibility.

### Template Block
- **Conditional Rendering**: The `{#if show}` block checks if the `show` prop is true. If so, the modal and its content are rendered; otherwise, nothing is displayed.
  
- **Accessibility**: Two `svelte-ignore` comments are used to bypass warnings about accessibility best practices regarding clickable events and interactive elements. This suggests that the modal is designed with a focus on functionality, possibly at the expense of full accessibility compliance.
  
- **Modal Structure**:
  - The outer `div` creates a fullscreen overlay using Tailwind CSS classes for positioning, background color, text color, width, height, and z-index. It ensures the modal covers the entire viewport and displays on top of other content.
  - Inside the outer `div`, there's a container for buttons aligned using flexbox. This container has two child `div` elements for the close and download buttons.
  
- **Close Button**: 
  - A button with an SVG icon represents a close (X) action. 
  - The `on:click` event handler sets the `show` prop to false, hiding the modal.
  
- **Download Button**:
  - Another button with an SVG icon intended for downloading the image. 
  - The `on:click` event handler dynamically creates an anchor (`<a>`) element, sets its `href` to the image's `src`, and triggers a click event on it, initiating the download with the default filename "Image.png".

- **Image Display**:
  - An `<img>` tag is used to display the actual image. 
  - The `src` and `alt` attributes are set to their respective props, and Tailwind CSS classes control its display properties, ensuring the image is centered and scaled down if necessary to fit within the modal.

### Summary
This Svelte component is a modal for previewing images. It appears as a full-screen overlay with an image centered on the screen when the `show` prop is `true`. Users can close the modal or download the image. The implementation demonstrates how Svelte's reactivity and conditional rendering can be leveraged to create dynamic UI components. This component could be easily integrated into a larger application where users need to preview and download images, such as a photo gallery or content management system.


## src/lib/components/common/Modal.svelte


This Svelte component creates a modal dialog with customizable size and an animated fade-in effect, designed to be included in Svelte-based web applications. Let's break it down:

### Script Tag with TypeScript
- **Imports**: The component imports `onMount` from Svelte for lifecycle management and `fade` from `svelte/transition` for applying transition effects.
- **Exports**: `show` and `size` are declared as exportable props, allowing parent components to control the visibility and size of the modal. The default values are `show = true` and `size = 'md'`.
- **Mounted State**: A local variable `mounted` tracks if the component has mounted to the DOM, initialized as `false` and set to `true` in the `onMount` lifecycle hook.
- **Size to Width Mapping**: `sizeToWidth` is a function that maps the `size` prop to a corresponding CSS width class. This allows for size customization (extra small, small, or default medium) of the modal.

### Reactive Statement
- **Overflow Control**: When the component is mounted (`onMount`), it conditionally sets the body's overflow style based on the `show` prop. This prevents scrolling of the background content when the modal is visible.

### Markup (Svelte HTML Template)
- **Conditional Rendering**: The modal's HTML structure is rendered only if `show` is true. It uses Svelte's `{#if}` block for conditional rendering.
- **Accessibility and Event Handling**: The modal's overlay listens for click events to close the modal (`show = false`). It uses `svelte-ignore` comments to bypass certain accessibility warnings related to click events and keyboard navigation.
- **Fade Transition**: The modal and its content use the `fade` transition for a fading effect when appearing or disappearing. The duration for the fade transition is set to 10 milliseconds.
- **Event Propagation**: A click event handler on the modal content stops the propagation of click events to prevent the modal from closing when clicking inside the modal content (`e.stopPropagation()`).
- **Dynamic Class Binding**: The modal content div dynamically binds a class for its width based on the `size` prop by calling the `sizeToWidth` function. It also applies styling classes for background color, shadow, and responsiveness.
- **Slot**: Uses a Svelte `<slot/>` to allow parent components to inject content into the modal.

### Style Tag
- **Animation**: Defines a `scaleUp` animation that slightly scales up the modal content and fades it in when the modal opens, giving a smooth and visually appealing entrance effect.

### Summary
This Svelte component is a versatile and reusable modal dialog with customizable sizes, smooth fade-in and scale-up animations, and accessibility considerations. The modal can be shown or hidden by toggling the `show` prop and can accommodate any content placed within its slot by parent components. The overlay prevents interaction with the background and optionally stops scrolling to keep the focus on the modal content.


## src/lib/components/common/Overlay.svelte

This Svelte component, named `Overlay`, creates an overlay UI feature that can be used across your frontend application, typically for displaying loading states or additional information on top of existing content. Let's break down its structure and functionality:

### Script Tag
Within the `<script>` tag, the component imports a `Spinner` component, which is likely a visual element indicating a loading process.

- `export let show = false;`: Exposes a `show` prop that controls the visibility of the overlay. It's initialized to `false`, meaning the overlay is hidden by default.
- `export let content = '';`: Exposes a `content` prop that allows the passing of text to be displayed on the overlay. It defaults to an empty string.
- `export let opacity = 1;`: Exposes an `opacity` prop to adjust the overlay's opacity, with a default value of `1` (fully opaque).

### Template Structure
The main structure within the `<div class="relative">` wrapper enables the overlay to position itself absolutely relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.

- `{#if show}`: This block conditionally renders the overlay based on the `show` prop. If `show` is `true`, the overlay and its contents are rendered.
  
  - The first nested `<div>` creates a backdrop with a slight blur effect (`backdrop-filter: blur(5px);`) and controlled opacity (`opacity: {opacity};`). The `inset: -10px;` style slightly expands the backdrop beyond the bounds of its parent, ensuring it covers the entire area including any potential borders.
  
  - The second nested `<div>` is designed to center the `Spinner` and `content` vertically and horizontally within the overlay. It uses Flexbox (`flex`, `justify-center`) for layout.
    
    - The `Spinner` component is included with a left margin (`ml-2`), visually indicating progress or loading.
    
    - The conditional `{#if content !== ''}` checks if the `content` prop contains text. If so, it displays the text centered (`text-center`) below the spinner. The styling aims for a subtle appearance (`text-gray-100 text-xs font-medium`) that doesn't overpower the underlying UI.

- `<slot />`: This is a Svelte slot that allows any content placed inside the `Overlay` component in its parent component to be rendered here. It makes the `Overlay` component flexible, allowing it to wrap around any arbitrary content.

### Summary
The `Overlay` component is a reusable UI component for Svelte applications, designed to show a loading spinner and optional text over content. Its visibility, content, and appearance can be controlled via props, making it versatile for various use cases like indicating a page or component is loading, or showing messages over a dimmed background. The use of slots further enhances its flexibility, enabling developers to overlay it on top of any content as needed.


## src/lib/components/common/Spinner.svelte

This Svelte component, named `Spinner`, is designed to display a loading indicator, commonly used to signal that a background process (like fetching data) is ongoing. Svelte components are a mix of markup, styles, and script that work together seamlessly. Let's break down this component:

### Script Tag with TypeScript
```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	export let className: string = 'text-white';
	export let theme: 'blue' | 'white' | 'black' = 'white';
</script>
```
- **TypeScript**: The component uses TypeScript (`<script lang="ts">`), adding type safety and other TypeScript features. TypeScript enhances JavaScript by adding types, interfaces, and more, helping developers catch errors early.
- **Exported Props**: Two props are defined and exported:
  - `className`: A string that allows consumers of the component to add custom CSS classes. It defaults to `'text-white'`, applying white color as the default text color.
  - `theme`: A prop restricted to three possible string values: `'blue'`, `'white'`, or `'black'`. It dictates the color theme of the spinner, defaulting to `'white'`.

### Markup for the Spinner
```svelte
<div class="flex justify-center text-center {className}">
    <svg ...>
        ...
    </svg>
</div>
```
- The spinner is wrapped inside a `<div>` with utility classes from Tailwind CSS (a utility-first CSS framework) for layout and alignment: `flex` and `justify-center` center the spinner horizontally, and `text-center` centers it within its container.
- The `{className}` dynamically applies any additional classes passed to the component.

### SVG Spinner
- An SVG element with an `animate-spin` class (another Tailwind CSS utility) makes the SVG rotate, creating the spinning animation effect.
- The SVG's color is dynamically set based on the `theme` prop using a ternary operation. Depending on the `theme` value, different text color utility classes are applied:
  - `'text-sky-600'` for a blue theme,
  - `'text-white'` for a white theme,
  - `'text-gray-600'` for a black theme.
- The SVG itself is composed of two parts:
  - A **circle** with an `opacity-25`, creating a dimmed circular border that doesn't spin, providing a background for the spinner.
  - A **path** with an `opacity-75`, which is the spinning part of the SVG, indicating progress.

### Usage
This spinner can be customized via the `className` and `theme` props, making it flexible for different parts of an application. For example, setting `theme="blue"` would make the spinner blue, suitable for a light background, while `className="mt-4"` would add a top margin.

### Summary
The `Spinner` component in Svelte showcases the power of Svelte combined with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for creating a reusable, customizable UI element. By manipulating SVG properties and using CSS classes, it provides a visually appealing way to indicate loading states across an application.

## src/lib/components/common/Tags.svelte

This Svelte component, named `Tags`, incorporates functionality for displaying a list of tags and adding new tags through an input field. The code snippet is written in Svelte, a modern framework for building reactive web interfaces with a component-based architecture. This particular component is using TypeScript (`<script lang="ts">`), which adds static types to JavaScript, enhancing code reliability and developer experience.

### Component Imports
- **`TagInput` and `TagList`**: Two child components are imported from `./Tags/TagInput.svelte` and `./Tags/TagList.svelte`, respectively. `TagInput` is likely responsible for rendering an input field where users can type new tags, and `TagList` displays the existing tags.

### Component Props
- **`tags`**: An array that holds the current list of tags. This prop is exported, allowing the parent component to pass down the list of tags to be displayed.
- **`deleteTag` and `addTag`**: Functions passed from the parent component that handle the logic for deleting and adding tags. These are exported as well, indicating they're expected to be supplied by the parent.

### Template Structure
- The component's template is a `div` with specific Tailwind CSS classes for layout and styling: `flex flex-row space-x-0.5 line-clamp-1`. This setup suggests the component is designed to display its content in a horizontal row, with a small space between child elements, and text truncation (line clamping) to ensure the content fits into a single line.
- **`TagList` Component**: Used here to display the list of `tags`. It listens for a custom `delete` event, which is triggered when a user wants to delete a tag. The handler for this event calls the `deleteTag` function, passing the tag's details (`e.detail`), which likely includes the identifier or name of the tag to be deleted.
- **`TagInput` Component**: Handles the addition of new tags. It listens for an `add` event, which is presumably emitted when a user submits a new tag through the input field. The event handler calls the `addTag` function with the new tag's details.

### How It Works Together
- When a user interacts with the `TagInput` field by adding a new tag, `TagInput` emits an `add` event. The `Tags` component catches this event and invokes the `addTag` function provided by the parent component, passing along the new tag details.
- Similarly, when a tag is to be deleted from the `TagList`, the `delete` event is emitted with the tag's details. The `Tags` component then calls the `deleteTag` function, also supplied by the parent, to handle the tag removal.
- This component effectively decouples the UI presentation (displaying and inputting tags) from the business logic (what happens when tags are added or removed), allowing for more reusable and maintainable code.

### Conclusion
The `Tags` Svelte component demonstrates a clean, component-based approach to managing a list of tags within a UI, leveraging Svelte's reactivity and TypeScript's static typing. It showcases how to compose UI elements, handle events, and communicate between child and parent components in a Svelte application.

### Modal Component
The modal is structured using the imported `Modal` component with a bound `show` property. This setup ensures that when `show` changes (either within this component or from a parent component), the modal's visibility updates accordingly.

### Header and Close Button
- The modal header includes a title (`Document Settings`) and a close button.
- The close button has an `on:click` event handler that sets `show` to `false`, closing the modal when clicked.
- The SVG within the button serves as the icon for the close button.

### Tab Navigation
- A navigation bar allows users to select different settings categories. Currently, only the "General" tab is implemented.
- The "General" button visually changes based on whether it's the selected tab, showing different background colors.
- Clicking the "General" button sets `selectedTab` to `'general'`, indicating that the General settings should be displayed.

### Content Area
- The content area dynamically displays content based on the value of `selectedTab`.
- With `selectedTab === 'general'`, the `General` component is rendered. This component likely contains form fields and options for configuring general document settings.
- The commented-out code hints at a possible extension of the modal to include other settings categories, such as 'users'.

### CSS Classes
- The component uses Tailwind CSS (a utility-first CSS framework) for styling, as indicated by classes like `flex`, `justify-between`, `dark:text-gray-300`, etc.
- This approach enables a responsive and customizable UI with minimal custom CSS.

### Interactivity and Reactivity
- Svelte's reactivity system ensures that changes to reactive variables (like `show` and `selectedTab`) automatically update the DOM. For instance, closing the modal or switching tabs immediately reflects in the UI without additional boilerplate code.

### Summary
`SettingsModal` is a Svelte component designed to provide a user-friendly interface for configuring document settings within a modal window. It demonstrates Svelte's capabilities for component composition, reactivity, and handling user interactions, all while leveraging Tailwind CSS for styling.

## src/lib/components/stores/index.ts

This Svelte code snippet is setting up reactive state management using writable stores provided by Svelte's store module. It's designed for a frontend application, likely meant to interact with a backend (as hinted by the comments within the code). Let's break down the code to understand its purpose and how it works:

### Imports
- `import { APP_NAME } from '$lib/constants';`: Imports a constant `APP_NAME` from a constants module, which likely holds application-wide constants.
- `import { writable } from 'svelte/store';`: Imports the `writable` function from Svelte's store module. This function is used to create a store that holds state which can be reactive. When the store's value changes, any component that subscribes to the store will automatically re-render with the new value.

### Backend Stores
- `export const WEBUI_NAME = writable(APP_NAME);`: Creates a writable store with the initial value set to `APP_NAME`. This store could be used to hold the application's name, which might be displayed in the UI.
- `export const config = writable(undefined);`: Initializes a store for holding application configuration, initially set to `undefined`.
- `export const user = writable(undefined);`: Initializes a store to hold user data, such as authentication status or user profile information, initially `undefined`.

### Frontend Stores
- `export const theme = writable('dark');`: Holds the current theme setting for the UI, initialized to `'dark'`. This could be used to toggle between light and dark modes in the application.
- `export const chatId = writable('');`: A store for the current chat ID, which could be used in a chat application to keep track of which chat is active.
- `export const chats = writable([]);`: Manages a list of chat sessions or messages.
- `export const tags = writable([]);`: Manages a list of tags, which could be used for categorizing or filtering content like chats or documents.
- `export const models = writable([]);`: Holds a list of models, possibly related to the backend AI or machine learning models mentioned in the backend code you described earlier.
- `export const modelfiles = writable([]);`: A store for managing model files, likely used to list or manage AI model files.
- `export const prompts = writable([]);`: Manages a list of prompts, which could be predefined queries or commands that users can select or use.
- `export const documents = writable([...]);`: Initializes with a sample list of documents. Each document has a `collection_name`, `filename`, `name`, and `title`. This store is likely used for managing and displaying documents within the application.
- `export const settings = writable({});`: A general store for application settings.
- `export const showSettings = writable(false);`: Controls the visibility of a settings modal or pane in the UI.
- `export const showChangelog = writable(false);`: Toggles the visibility of a changelog or updates section in the application.

### Summary
This code snippet is foundational for managing the state of a Svelte-based frontend application. It neatly categorizes the state into backend-related and frontend-specific stores, indicating a well-structured approach to state management. By leveraging Svelte's reactive stores, the application can efficiently update the UI in response to changes in state, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user experience.

## src/lib/components/utils/rag/index.ts

This TypeScript code snippet is part of a frontend application that interacts with a backend service to fetch a template for a Retrieve and Generate (RAG) process, then customizes this template based on provided context and query. The code is structured as a module that exports a single async function named `RAGTemplate`. Let's break it down:

### Import Statement
- `import { getRAGTemplate } from '$lib/apis/rag';`: This line imports the `getRAGTemplate` function from a module that is likely responsible for making API calls to the backend. The `$lib/apis/rag` path suggests a structured project where API call functions are organized under the `lib/apis` directory. The dollar sign (`$`) prefix might indicate a special alias or shortcut set up in the project's build configuration, pointing to a specific directory.

### RAGTemplate Function
- `export const RAGTemplate = async (token: string, context: string, query: string) => { ... }`: Exports an asynchronous function named `RAGTemplate`. This function takes three parameters: `token` (likely an authentication token), `context` (the context information to be included in the template), and `query` (the user's query that needs to be answered based on the context).

### Fetching the Template
- Inside the function, it first attempts to fetch the RAG template from the backend by calling `getRAGTemplate(token)`. This function call is wrapped in a `try-catch` block using `Promise.catch()`, ensuring that if the call fails (e.g., due to network issues or if the backend service is down), a default template string is returned instead.

### Customizing the Template
- If the template is successfully fetched, it then customizes this template by replacing placeholders with actual content:
  - `.replace(/\[context\]/g, context)`: Replaces all occurrences of `[context]` in the template with the provided `context` string.
  - `.replace(/\[query\]/g, query)`: Replaces all occurrences of `[query]` in the template with the provided `query` string.

### Return Value
- The function finally returns the customized template. This template is ready to be used, for example, to display instructions or to be sent back to the backend for further processing based on the RAG model's capabilities.

### Summary
The `RAGTemplate` function serves as an intermediary step in preparing a request for a RAG model by fetching a template, customizing it with specific context and query data, and handling cases where the template cannot be fetched by providing a fallback. This approach allows for dynamic generation of requests based on templates stored or defined in the backend, enabling flexible and context-sensitive interactions with the RAG model.

## src/lib/components/utils/index.ts

 and simplifying maintenance.

 ## src/lib/constants.ts


This JavaScript (or TypeScript) module defines a set of constants used throughout a SvelteKit frontend application. These constants are primarily focused on configuration settings such as API base URLs, app versioning, and supported file types for uploads. Let's go through the key parts:

### Environment Detection
- `import { dev } from '$app/environment';` imports a boolean flag (`dev`) from SvelteKit's environment module, which indicates whether the app is running in development mode. This is used to conditionally set values based on the environment (development vs. production).

### Base URL Configuration
- `WEBUI_BASE_URL` is set based on whether the app is in development mode. If in development, it uses the current location's hostname with port `8080`; otherwise, it's set to an empty string. This is likely used as a base to construct URLs for various backend services.
- `WEBUI_API_BASE_URL` and other similar constants (`LITELLM_API_BASE_URL`, `OLLAMA_API_BASE_URL`, etc.) build upon `WEBUI_BASE_URL` to define the base URLs for different parts of the backend system or different microservices (like LITELLM, OLLAMA, OPENAI, AUDIO, IMAGES, RAG). These are used when making API calls to these services.

### Versioning

## src/routes/auth/+page.svelte

This Svelte component is for an authentication page that supports both sign-in and sign-up functionalities for a web application. The component is built using Svelte, a modern JavaScript framework that enables developers to build fast and reactive web interfaces. Let's break down the code into its key parts:

### Script Section
- **Imports**: The component imports several modules and functions, including `goto` for navigation, authentication API functions (`userSignIn`, `userSignUp`), constants, stores (`WEBUI_NAME`, `config`, `user`), and `onMount` for lifecycle management. It also imports `toast` from `svelte-sonner` for displaying success and error messages.
- **Variables**: Several reactive variables (`loaded`, `mode`, `name`, `email`, `password`) are declared to manage the component's state, including form inputs and the mode (sign-in vs. sign-up).
- **setSessionUser Function**: This async function sets the user session upon successful authentication. It stores the token in `localStorage`, updates the user store, and redirects the user to the homepage.
- **signInHandler and signUpHandler Functions**: These async functions handle sign-in and sign-up operations by calling the respective API functions, handling errors with toast notifications, and calling `setSessionUser` on success.
- **submitHandler Function**: Based on the current mode (sign-in or sign-up), this function calls either `signInHandler` or `signUpHandler`.
- **onMount Lifecycle Hook**: Checks if a user is already signed in upon component mount; if so, redirects to the homepage. Also sets `loaded` to `true` to render the component.

### HTML Template Section
- **Conditional Rendering**: The component renders only if `loaded` is `true`. This ensures the component does not flash or partially render before it's fully initialized.
- **Logo and Title**: Displays an application logo and dynamically sets the page title to `$WEBUI_NAME`.
- **Form for Authentication**: A form is presented with fields for name (only shown in sign-up mode), email, and password. It includes basic validation and placeholders.
- **Switch Mode Button**: Allows users to switch between sign-in and sign-up modes, updating the form fields and button labels accordingly.
- **Submission Button**: A button to submit the form, triggering the `submitHandler`.

### Styling Section
- Defines custom styling for the component, notably setting a font family.

### Key Features
- **Reactivity**: Svelte's reactivity system automatically updates the UI in response to state changes, such as toggling between sign-in and sign-up modes.
- **User Feedback**: Uses toasts to provide instant feedback on sign-in/sign-up operations, enhancing the user experience.
- **Secure Authentication Flow**: Manages authentication tokens securely, storing them in `localStorage` and updating the global user state.
- **Navigation Control**: Redirects users based on their authentication state, ensuring a seamless flow within the application.

### Summary
This component exemplifies a modern approach to handling user authentication in web applications. It offers a responsive and interactive UI for both signing in and signing up, complete with user feedback and secure session management. Utilizing Svelte's reactivity and stores, along with external APIs and utility functions, it encapsulates a significant part of the user experience related to authentication within a single, manageable file.


## src/routes/error/+page.svelte


This Svelte component is designed for a frontend application that interacts with a backend server. It serves as an error page, guiding users when the frontend is accessed without the necessary backend connection. The code is structured using Svelte's reactivity, component lifecycle, and conditional rendering capabilities. Let's break it down:

### Script Tag
- **Imports**: The component imports several utilities and store values. `goto` is from SvelteKit's navigation module for programmatically changing routes. `WEBUI_NAME` and `config` are presumably Svelte stores, holding application-wide configurations or states. `onMount` is a lifecycle function in Svelte, called after the component is initially rendered on the page.
- **Local State `loaded`**: A boolean variable to track if the component has finished attempting to verify the backend connection.
- **onMount Lifecycle**: Within this function, the component checks if there's existing configuration (presumably indicating a backend connection). If `$config` is present (indicative of a successful backend connection), it redirects the user to the homepage (`/`). Afterward, it sets `loaded` to `true` to indicate that the check is complete.

### HTML Template
- **Conditional Rendering `{#if loaded}`**: The component content is displayed only if `loaded` is `true`. This ensures users don't see the error message before the app has a chance to verify the backend connection.
- **Structure and Styling**: The error message is styled to be centered and visually distinct, using TailwindCSS classes for layout, background, typography, and hover effects. The design aims to be user-friendly and clear in communicating the error state.
- **Error Message**: Informs the user that the backend is required for the application to work correctly and that they're currently using an unsupported method (frontend only). It provides links to the project's GitHub for installation instructions and an invitation to join a Discord community for further help.
- **Action Button "Check Again"**: A button that, when clicked, reloads the page (`location.href = '/'`). This allows users to quickly recheck if the backend connection has been established after following the provided instructions.

### Summary
This Svelte component is built to handle cases where the frontend application is accessed without its necessary backend. It guides users on how to set up the backend or seek help. The use of Svelte's reactive features and lifecycle functions ensures the user experience is smooth and the interface updates appropriately based on the application state. The inclusion of actionable advice and community support options helps prevent user frustration in case of errors.


## src/routes/+error.svelte

This Svelte code snippet is for an error handling component designed to be used in a SvelteKit application, which utilizes the Svelte framework. The purpose of this component is to display error messages to the user in a styled manner when an error occurs in the application. Let's break down each part of the code:

### Script Tag
```svelte
<script>
    import { page } from '$app/stores';
</script>
```
- **Imports**: The `page` store from `$app/stores` is imported. SvelteKit provides this store to access page-level data, including parameters, URL, and in this case, error details such as the HTTP status code and error message.
- **Purpose**: The script tag is used to include JavaScript logic in the Svelte component. It allows the component to interact with the application's state, in this case, to display error information.

### HTML Structure
The HTML part of the component defines its structure and appearance:
```html
<div class=" bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 min-h-screen">
    <div class=" flex h-full">
        <div class="m-auto my-10 dark:text-gray-300 text-3xl font-semibold">
            {$page.status}: {$page.error.message}
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```
- **Outer `div`**: Sets the background color to white (`bg-white`) in light mode and dark gray (`dark:bg-gray-800`) in dark mode, ensuring the error page matches the user's theme preference. It also ensures that the div takes up at least the full height of the screen (`min-h-screen`).
- **Flex Container `div`**: Uses Flexbox (`flex`) to center its contents vertically and horizontally within the page. It ensures the error message is centered in the viewport, making it more visually accessible to the user.
- **Error Message `div`**: 
  - `m-auto` applies automatic margins on all sides, centering the text block within its container.
  - `my-10` adds vertical margins to create some space above and below the error message.
  - `dark:text-gray-300` sets the text color to a lighter gray in dark mode for better readability against the dark background.
  - `text-3xl` and `font-semibold` increase the font size and weight, making the error message prominent on the page.
- **Displaying Error Information**: `{$page.status}: {$page.error.message}` dynamically displays the HTTP status code and the associated error message retrieved from the SvelteKit's `page` store. This ensures that users are informed about the nature of the error in a user-friendly manner.

### Summary
This SvelteKit error component is designed to present error information in a user-friendly and visually appealing way, taking into consideration both light and dark mode preferences. It makes use of Svelte's reactivity to dynamically display error details and utilizes CSS classes for styling. The component can be customized further based on specific design requirements or to provide additional information or options to the user in the event of an error.

## src/routes/+layout.svelte


This Svelte component serves as a layout for a web application, leveraging the Svelte framework and its store system for reactive state management. It integrates several key functionalities, including theme management, session validation, backend configuration retrieval, and user interface elements. Here's a breakdown of its features and workings:

### Script Section
- **Imports**: The script starts by importing necessary utilities, components, and stores. It imports Svelte's lifecycle hook `onMount`, the store `config`, `user`, `theme`, and a constant `WEBUI_NAME` for dynamic configuration and state management. It also imports functions for navigation (`goto`), toast notifications (`Toaster`, `toast`), API calls (`getBackendConfig`, `getSessionUser`), and stylesheets.

- **Variables**: Defines a reactive variable `loaded` to track if the initial loading and setup process has completed.

- **onMount Hook**: This lifecycle hook runs when the component mounts to the DOM. It performs several asynchronous operations:
    - Sets the theme based on the user's preference stored in `localStorage`.
    - Calls `getBackendConfig()` to fetch the application's backend configuration, including the application name. Upon success, it updates the `config` and `WEBUI_NAME` stores.
    - Checks if a token exists in `localStorage` (indicating a logged-in session). If it does, it attempts to fetch session user data using `getSessionUser()`. Successful retrieval updates the `user` store; failure leads to the removal of the token and redirection to the authentication page.
    - If no backend configuration is fetched, it redirects the user to an error page.

- **await tick()**: Ensures all the pending state updates are processed before setting `loaded` to `true`, allowing the content to render.

### Head Section
- Dynamically sets the page title based on the `WEBUI_NAME` store.
- Specifies the favicon and theme stylesheets for the application.

### Render Logic
- Uses an `{#if loaded}` block to conditionally render the content (`<slot />`) only after the initial setup is completed, preventing flicker or partially loaded UI.
- Incorporates a `<Toaster>` component for displaying toast notifications with a predefined position. It's used for error handling and feedback.

### CSS Imports
- The component imports global stylesheets for the application's look and feel (`app.css`, `tailwind.css`) and third-party components (`tippy.css` for tooltips).

### Summary
This layout component serves as a foundational piece that wraps around the application's content, ensuring that critical configurations, user sessions, and themes are set up before the rest of the UI loads. It enhances user experience by managing themes, handling session authentication proactively, and providing a mechanism for user feedback through toast notifications. By doing so, it ensures a consistent and user-friendly interface across the application.
